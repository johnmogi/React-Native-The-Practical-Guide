00:02.160 --> 00:08.820
Now to output our list of goals here in THE VIEW I want to simply output a couple of text components

00:08.820 --> 00:16.290
for now where I simply print my goal and to do that we can enter a dynamic expression here with single

00:16.290 --> 00:17.910
opening and closing curly braces.

00:18.390 --> 00:25.860
And now we refer to course goals which is this variable we got here with a radio structuring course

00:25.860 --> 00:27.890
goals is our array of goals.

00:28.110 --> 00:34.620
And now just as in normal react which is a differentiation I don't really like because we are using

00:34.800 --> 00:36.350
normal react here in the end.

00:36.750 --> 00:43.590
So just like you know it from react for web projects you can now map this array of data into an array

00:43.590 --> 00:50.280
of components with the map method which is a normal javascript method the map method takes a function

00:50.280 --> 00:52.230
which executes on every item.

00:52.230 --> 00:53.180
India right.

00:53.190 --> 01:00.810
So here we get our goal and it then has to return a new component here again I'll use this inline aerial

01:00.810 --> 01:07.230
function syntax where instead of having curly braces and then returning something I will miss de curly

01:07.230 --> 01:11.340
braces and I admit the return statement does is valid javascript syntax.

01:11.370 --> 01:13.980
This will also return whatever I enter here.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.740
What I want to return is a text component.

01:17.880 --> 01:26.430
So this text component we imported from React Native and with this we can now output our goal here because

01:26.430 --> 01:32.280
a golden course goals will just be a text because what we add to course goals is the entered goal and

01:32.280 --> 01:36.100
the entered goal is what we get from text input and that's just text.

01:36.570 --> 01:42.210
So here we're now just outputting some text and I'm mapping all my course goals into text components

01:42.390 --> 01:49.630
which will be output in this view here and with that if we safeties we should already be able to start

01:49.720 --> 01:51.130
adding some goals.

01:51.220 --> 01:59.260
So learn React Native is one thing I can enter here hit ad and here it is learn it for real and we get

01:59.260 --> 02:00.950
this as well.

02:01.050 --> 02:06.300
And if you also want to make some pancakes while you can do that as well of course as all the works

02:06.300 --> 02:11.610
and I guess learn to react native for real.

02:11.980 --> 02:18.480
And of course I still want to make some pancakes.

02:18.550 --> 02:23.960
So this is working and this is how we can output a simple very trivial list of items here.

02:23.980 --> 02:29.830
Now of course these items look rather boring though so maybe we can apply some styling there to make

02:29.830 --> 02:33.120
them look better before we do that though.

02:33.340 --> 02:36.680
Please note that we have an error here in our terminal.

02:36.730 --> 02:41.350
Now our app clearly works but the error we're getting here is that each child in a list should have

02:41.350 --> 02:46.190
a unique key prop and that's a normal react rule nothing React Native specific.

02:46.300 --> 02:52.930
Indeed you should always when mapping does to a list of widgets assign a key here so to react as able

02:52.930 --> 02:58.750
to efficiently update this list behind the scenes if it needs to you do this by adding a key prop here

02:59.110 --> 03:01.730
and then the key should be some unique identifier.

03:01.780 --> 03:05.890
For now let's go with the goal itself which isn't strictly unique.

03:05.890 --> 03:09.970
You could enter the same gold with the same text twice which would give you an error.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.650
But for now let's assume you're not doing that.

03:12.670 --> 03:17.720
Therefore we can use gold as a key and if we do that we're getting rid of that warning.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.850
If I now learned React Native I can add this without an error.

03:21.850 --> 03:27.610
Again if I add the same text twice while then technically I don't even get an area but this would be

03:27.610 --> 03:28.040
wrong.

03:28.040 --> 03:32.170
I hear this here is the error because I got two children with the same key.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.650
So for now we'll just assume that you don't do that though.

03:35.770 --> 03:40.580
That's the normal key rule you have in normal react as well.

03:40.780 --> 03:46.210
So let's simply assume you don't enter the same goal twice and let's continue with styling these items

03:46.210 --> 03:48.910
because right now they're not looking too exciting.
