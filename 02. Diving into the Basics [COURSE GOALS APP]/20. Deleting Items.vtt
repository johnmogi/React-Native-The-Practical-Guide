00:02.600 --> 00:08.300
Now to delete the item which was pressed I'll add a new function here in my app component.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.790
So a new function which has stored in this constant.

00:11.150 --> 00:13.750
And I'll name it remove goal handler.

00:13.970 --> 00:20.180
And here I expect to get the goal I.D. as I input because this idea allows us to identify the item which

00:20.180 --> 00:22.280
we want to remove as an alternative.

00:22.280 --> 00:26.620
We could also get the index India array and then removed the item by index.

00:26.630 --> 00:32.450
But I think the idea is even better because well we have an I.D. clearly matched to every item why wouldn't

00:32.450 --> 00:34.480
we use that for the leading it.

00:34.750 --> 00:40.220
And now in here we can set our course goals because of course I want to update my course goals.

00:40.220 --> 00:45.070
And again we're making an update that's based on our current course goals.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.190
So I'll use that function form here.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.400
I pass a function an anonymous function to set course goals.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.610
There I get my current state snapshot.

00:52.610 --> 00:57.890
My current course goals and in the function body I have to return the updated course goals.

00:57.890 --> 01:04.490
Now in case you're wondering why I don't have curly braces UP HERE here I use the shorter syntax where

01:04.490 --> 01:06.860
I only have one expression which I want to return.

01:06.860 --> 01:10.500
So I amidst the function body and the return statement here.

01:10.730 --> 01:15.380
I'll have a little bit of a longer statement therefore I want to have the function body here for readability

01:15.860 --> 01:22.430
because in your all return current goals filter because filter is a built in method built into javascript

01:22.730 --> 01:28.940
that allows us to return a new array filter always yields a new array which is based on the old array

01:28.940 --> 01:32.800
on which you're calling it filtered by a certain criteria.

01:32.840 --> 01:39.260
Now the criteria is new and passed with the help of a function which you pass to filter this function

01:39.260 --> 01:45.540
which you pass to filter gets the goal because this function runs on every element on the array you're

01:45.540 --> 01:46.490
calling it.

01:46.490 --> 01:51.800
So in this case it runs on every goal we have in the current golden array and therefore we get that

01:51.800 --> 01:52.220
goal.

01:52.220 --> 01:57.890
It's currently running on and now we can return true if we want to keep that item or false if we want

01:57.890 --> 02:05.150
to drop it and we want to return true if the idea of the goal we're looking at is not equal to the goal

02:05.250 --> 02:09.560
I.D. We're getting us our argument because that's the idea of goal we want to delete.

02:09.710 --> 02:14.750
So we only want to keep items where these ideas do not match because if they do match then that's the

02:14.750 --> 02:16.000
item we want to get rid of.

02:16.070 --> 02:19.580
And therefore we of course want to drop it from our new Array.

02:20.120 --> 02:25.820
So this is defaulter logic for getting rid of all item and returning this here as our new state which

02:25.820 --> 02:27.620
is new and set thereafter.

02:27.620 --> 02:35.810
Now we can connect remove handler to on delete and now here we got two options or multiple options of

02:35.810 --> 02:36.760
doing this.

02:36.830 --> 02:42.200
We can simply point add remove goal handler but keep in mind that you need to pass the I.D. So option

02:42.200 --> 02:50.710
number one is that you also forward the idea here to goal item by simply pointing at item data dot item

02:50.770 --> 02:57.760
dot I.D. because just as each item has a value each item here also has an I.D. because we're adding

02:57.760 --> 03:03.260
an idea when we're adding an item up there and now as IDs we pass the I.D. to the goal item and we pass

03:03.260 --> 03:09.280
the on delete prop to the goal item inside of the goal item here where we call on delete in the end

03:09.280 --> 03:14.320
or where we forward the handler on delete points at 2 on press.

03:14.320 --> 03:20.320
We could all the bind this to set a default argument when this gets called into default arguments here

03:20.320 --> 03:25.900
would be props ideas so the idea we're all getting so that this idea is passed 2 on delete when it's

03:25.900 --> 03:32.800
getting called upon a press that's option number 1 and it's the option I will use but also to show you

03:32.800 --> 03:38.530
the other option the other option would be that you don't pass the I.D. 2 goal item but instead here

03:38.530 --> 03:44.050
on delete you know in the end the removed goal handler will be executed and then here you could add

03:44.080 --> 03:50.590
bind this and then point that item data item I.D. Dad would all the work.

03:51.040 --> 03:56.280
Now I will revert this however and I will go with the approach where all the information is instead

03:56.290 --> 04:04.030
of the goal item and we do connect our function with the idea from inside to go item now is that we

04:04.030 --> 04:06.880
should have a setup where we can all delete our goals.

04:06.910 --> 04:13.780
So let's wait for this to reload and let's test it maybe here on us we want to learn React Native and

04:13.840 --> 04:17.830
now I want to use different names so that we can see if we deleted the right one.

04:17.830 --> 04:26.520
We want to learn it all we want you maybe also get really good at React Native and whatever it is.

04:26.980 --> 04:33.790
And now I will actually click on learn it all to to delete that and that seems to work here.

04:34.060 --> 04:35.710
Learn React Native and now.

04:35.710 --> 04:40.720
The last one all delete it and also without any errors here.

04:40.750 --> 04:47.440
So this seems to work fine with Dad we're deleting items with the help of touchable touchable opacity

04:47.440 --> 04:54.430
in this case which helps you register events like on press on any component or on any components you

04:54.430 --> 04:54.700
need.
