00:02.240 --> 00:04.430
Now does all the nice practice for you.

00:04.460 --> 00:09.440
You can post the video here and try positioning these two buttons next to Java on your own.

00:09.440 --> 00:15.190
Only did two buttons not the input into two buttons but these two buttons should be in a new line below

00:15.200 --> 00:17.430
the input but then sit next to each other.

00:17.570 --> 00:23.610
After a short pause which you can use to pass the video we'll of course do that together.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.440
So where are you successful.

00:25.450 --> 00:26.950
Let's try it together.

00:26.990 --> 00:34.670
The key here is to use flex box and our view because again as I mentioned earlier and as is really important

00:34.670 --> 00:41.530
there is stand view components are your core component for organizing our components or for being used

00:41.530 --> 00:43.570
as a container which you can also style.

00:43.600 --> 00:49.610
But here in this case to organize other components so I'll move the two buttons instead of that view.

00:49.720 --> 00:55.720
And now we can assign a style to that view and that style of course will be defined here in our style

00:55.750 --> 00:59.660
object in all named as Button container.

00:59.710 --> 01:06.400
This is up to you does name and in there I want to set a flex direction of row to have him sit next

01:06.400 --> 01:13.360
to each other and then I'll set justify content of space between to have the free space between the

01:13.360 --> 01:16.330
two buttons.

01:16.340 --> 01:25.190
Now let's add to stall here too that view styles button container and safeties and now here are the

01:25.190 --> 01:32.420
buttons but to have the free space have an effect here which will be even clearer on Android by the

01:32.420 --> 01:34.900
way that it's currently not having any effect.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.880
So that space between us not having any effect.

01:37.910 --> 01:41.820
Let me quickly show it is on Android.

01:42.030 --> 01:42.410
You see it.

01:42.420 --> 01:43.890
There is no free space.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.790
The reason for that simply is that we have no width assigned to our button container and therefore has

01:47.790 --> 01:48.200
learned.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.100
It only takes the width of the children.

01:50.370 --> 01:52.660
And that is simply the width of the two buttons.

01:52.710 --> 01:53.820
Add it together.

01:53.940 --> 01:56.570
Hence there is no free space to add in between.

01:56.610 --> 02:01.410
So we have some free space in between we simply need to assign a with to the button container.

02:01.530 --> 02:05.800
And now Dad width is of course up to you since the input has 80 percent.

02:05.820 --> 02:14.340
We could go with 80 percent here as well or maybe with 60 percent to have it a little bit more narrow

02:14.400 --> 02:20.130
Dendi input above so that the buttons do not sit on the edges of the input but that's of course up to

02:20.130 --> 02:21.090
you.

02:21.090 --> 02:27.060
And they are for now with Dad if this reloads and we have a look at this on Android.

02:27.060 --> 02:33.390
By using this convenient way of closing it and restarting it now we should see some free space between

02:33.390 --> 02:34.930
these two buttons.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.730
Yeah that's looking good.

02:36.770 --> 02:38.700
And of course you can play around with that.

02:38.730 --> 02:42.830
You could also alternatively of course add styles to the buttons.

02:42.840 --> 02:49.440
You can add style props here too and add a margin on the left and right of each button that would have

02:49.440 --> 02:50.510
work too.

02:50.520 --> 02:56.250
You can also play around with our values here like space around to have the free space to the left and

02:56.250 --> 02:58.710
right of the buttons and not just between them.

02:58.770 --> 03:03.000
These are all things you can do I'll go with space around here and have a final look at this.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
But ultimately that's of course simply something that's up to you.

03:06.030 --> 03:11.400
Important here is of course that you understand how you can achieve something with the help of a view

03:11.550 --> 03:15.390
which you wrap around your buttons and flex Buxton.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.900
And with that I'd say we have a decent look here.

03:19.110 --> 03:26.550
Now one last thing really last thing which I also want to do is resize these buttons because they're

03:26.550 --> 03:31.380
not equally sized and I think it would look a bit nicer if they had the same size.

03:31.410 --> 03:37.920
Now on a button you can't add a style prop and set the with no matter if you're using inline styles

03:37.950 --> 03:40.700
or the stylus sheet object instead.

03:40.710 --> 03:44.050
And that's something you have to know which is why I'm covering it here.

03:44.100 --> 03:51.860
You have to wrap your button into a separate view like I'm doing it here and then give that view a button

03:52.070 --> 03:59.270
for example here we could add styles button referring to a button property down there to each view and

03:59.270 --> 04:05.990
there on this button property which I'm now adding you could add a width of let's say 40 percent and

04:05.990 --> 04:08.780
that will be 40 percent off the parent of that view.

04:08.780 --> 04:15.440
So 40 percent of that button container view which itself takes 60 percent of the entire available width

04:16.220 --> 04:20.580
and we can do this on the upper button as well of course.

04:20.600 --> 04:28.010
So that's just something you have to know if you add your surrounding views here around your buttons.

04:28.010 --> 04:34.490
Now with that if we again restart Android we should have buttons that are equally sized which of course

04:34.580 --> 04:36.710
often something you want.

04:36.710 --> 04:42.980
Of course you could have also used pixel value here instead of percentage values but now with that I'm

04:43.220 --> 04:44.710
really happy.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.590
I think that's now rehab that's looking good behaving good.

04:48.710 --> 04:51.320
And yet it's a good start with react native.

04:51.320 --> 04:57.140
Now obviously there is so much more we can learn and we will dive into so much more we can do regarding

04:57.140 --> 05:02.540
the styling because as already mentioned does is certainly not the most beautiful app you ever built

05:03.110 --> 05:05.990
but we covered a lot of important fundamentals here.
