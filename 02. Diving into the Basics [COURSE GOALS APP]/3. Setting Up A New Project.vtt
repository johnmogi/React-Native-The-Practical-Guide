00:02.270 --> 00:07.850
For this ultra deep brand new project again with Expo expo in it and then the name of your choice and

00:07.880 --> 00:13.040
I'll name it are in complete guide because in the end this is a complete wreck native guide what you've

00:13.040 --> 00:16.790
got here and I'll start with the blank template here Soledad.

00:16.810 --> 00:22.700
First option Mike is here regarding the name I'll named as R and guide but you can choose any name you

00:22.700 --> 00:29.570
want here is simply hit enter and I'll go with NPM not with yarn and now just as in the first core section.

00:29.570 --> 00:33.390
This will create a new project and set up by react native app in there.

00:33.410 --> 00:37.120
So let's wait for this to finish and with it finished.

00:37.120 --> 00:44.040
You could follow these instructions but I'll not do this here instead here I am back in Visual Studio

00:44.100 --> 00:49.020
code still with my first app from the first section opened and I'll open the new one now.

00:49.030 --> 00:53.750
The one we just created and here is the project open up individual pseudocode.

00:53.760 --> 00:58.660
I walked through all the core files and folders we have here in the first course modules so not repeat

00:58.660 --> 00:59.770
this here.

00:59.970 --> 01:05.820
And with that opened up here invidious pseudocode I'll now actually go to the menu and then choose terminal

01:05.820 --> 01:12.420
new terminal to open up my system terminal or a system command prompt depending on which operating system

01:12.420 --> 01:15.270
you're working on here in the eye to eat.

01:15.300 --> 01:21.660
So that's your normal command prompt your normal terminal just integrated into the I.T. and already

01:21.660 --> 01:26.220
navigated into that project folder so you don't need to use to navigate anywhere else.

01:26.290 --> 01:30.520
And now here I'll run NPM start and this will do the same as if I would have run it here.

01:30.590 --> 01:37.230
The difference is now I always see errors or any log messages directly here in the I.T. which is more

01:37.230 --> 01:38.630
convenient to work with.

01:38.700 --> 01:44.360
We still got that process which you should keep on running to get these live updates when you save something.

01:44.370 --> 01:50.130
You see the commands you can type your or the shortcuts you can press to launch your app on emulators

01:51.260 --> 01:59.030
and you also have that browser tab up and running here for your application the export dev tools.

01:59.030 --> 02:05.060
Now I got to emulators up and running your Android and I guess you don't need that of course but I want

02:05.060 --> 02:07.380
to show you how does Apple Juice and both.

02:07.440 --> 02:15.240
And it can run this app on Android by pressing a here in the terminal and I can run it on I w too by

02:15.240 --> 02:18.180
pressing I and I did both here.

02:18.180 --> 02:23.450
Alternatively we could have used these buttons here in the Expo dev tools in the browser.

02:23.610 --> 02:29.430
So now it is launching the app here on these devices on the android and Iowa simulator and I'll be back

02:29.430 --> 02:32.420
once it is finished because the first launch always takes a bit longer.

02:32.460 --> 02:39.830
Subsequent rebuilds reloads are way faster of course and here we get that starting app or running on

02:39.830 --> 02:41.560
these emulators.

02:41.700 --> 02:47.960
Now in case that looks a bit different for you attached you find my starting Project in exactly the

02:47.960 --> 02:51.170
same way I have it here so that you can all use that.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.820
Replace the files in your project with mine.

02:53.990 --> 02:57.920
And then if you run NPM start get well this look here.

02:57.920 --> 03:02.030
So this is the starting project will now build up on and will now work on.
