00:02.310 --> 00:08.520
So let's all these components there and for that we want to apply some style to the text components

00:09.120 --> 00:12.780
the text component does indeed support to stall a property.

00:12.780 --> 00:19.680
As you can verify in the official box but the text component actually does support less stalling features

00:19.710 --> 00:20.610
than the view does.

00:20.970 --> 00:26.030
And therefore I'll wrap this into another view component and that's just a view component.

00:26.040 --> 00:31.560
We are importing from React Native that's all to the part I meant with you only got a couple of base

00:31.560 --> 00:36.960
components but they'll get you very far because you work with views and patterns and texts all the time

00:37.530 --> 00:44.730
so you're all wrap as text with the opening and closing view component here and now here we have more

00:44.730 --> 00:46.090
styling options.

00:46.290 --> 00:50.730
Now again I'll not go for inline styles here but add styles to the style sheet.

00:50.730 --> 00:54.000
For example we could named as list item but the name is up to you.

00:54.210 --> 01:03.810
And let's say here we want to have a padding of 10 LEDs so maybe give it a background color of this

01:03.810 --> 01:17.750
grey hex code here give it a border color of black and also a border width of 1.

01:17.880 --> 01:25.720
And now let's assign list item as a style tutors have you are referring to styles that list item here.

01:25.770 --> 01:34.380
And with that if we save this now our list item should look a bit better learn React Native.

01:34.610 --> 01:39.620
This is how it looks like now some spacing would probably also be nice.

01:39.620 --> 01:46.850
We can achieve Dad with margin padding is spacing between the border and the content margin is spacing

01:46.850 --> 01:49.270
between the border and the surrounding contents.

01:49.280 --> 01:55.130
So the average elements around it and dare we could add margin 10 to add a margin in all directions

01:55.460 --> 01:59.600
we could all just add a margin to the top or just to the bottom or.

01:59.720 --> 02:06.050
And that's something which doesn't exist in C S S you can add a margin vertical of 10 to have a margin

02:06.050 --> 02:08.560
to top and bottom but not left and right.

02:08.720 --> 02:15.770
And that's by the way an example of how this is based on CSX but it's not the same because margin vertical

02:15.860 --> 02:23.210
wouldn't be a property you haven't CSX while you have it and react native so if we know it's safe.

02:23.210 --> 02:29.840
Dad and we add learn and react native here.

02:30.030 --> 02:38.430
Now you see there is some spacing between those items and of course also on Io s if we do it there.

02:38.550 --> 02:46.440
So there's not adds our items and whilst we probably still don't win a beauty award it's a good start

02:46.440 --> 02:51.050
at least will dive way deeper into styling and all you can do there later in this course.

02:51.060 --> 02:54.090
We just have to get there is step by step of course.

02:54.090 --> 03:00.750
Now one thing we have to adjust now by the way the key here always has to be on the the route element

03:00.750 --> 03:01.460
in your list.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.730
So the element which you are repeating and we're not just repeating the text anymore instead we're now

03:05.730 --> 03:07.020
repeating the entire view.

03:07.320 --> 03:14.430
So the key should be added to that view here not to the text in the view that's why I got this warning

03:14.430 --> 03:15.520
or this error again.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.230
Now with the key moved to the view instead of the text this should be gone.
