00:02.560 --> 00:08.680
For centering the content in the middle we can use a technique I already covered earlier styling and

00:08.710 --> 00:11.500
they're specifically flex box.

00:11.500 --> 00:17.470
So on our model we have that view where in our model we have that view that's our route view.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.400
It's the only element in the model.

00:19.420 --> 00:25.090
And then this view of course has other child elements but that's the only direct child of our model.

00:25.180 --> 00:29.310
There we have the input container style which we apply and there we currently set a flex directional

00:29.350 --> 00:30.490
row.

00:30.490 --> 00:35.170
Now of course we could leave that but I'd say intermodal if we presented on a full screen like this

00:35.620 --> 00:41.230
I'm actually fine with the vertical orientation so that we have the input and below that the button.

00:41.610 --> 00:48.250
So I'll change this back to column or since this is the default simply delete this flex direction.

00:48.250 --> 00:52.580
And now I want you centered as horizontally and vertically though.

00:52.810 --> 00:59.480
And for Dad we can set justified content to center here and a line items to center.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.690
But data alone won't do the trick.

01:01.780 --> 01:05.710
You can see if you open a modal it's still all the way at the top.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.920
And the reason for data is that our input container.

01:07.930 --> 01:14.080
So that view we're assigning this style to by default doesn't take the full away level space it can

01:14.080 --> 01:16.720
get in these surrounding you.

01:16.720 --> 01:22.450
So in this case in the model the modal theoretically takes the full height and width of the screen but

01:22.480 --> 01:25.480
the view simply doesn't take that full available space by default.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.560
That's just how it works.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.630
That's the default setting.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.900
It only takes the space its children require.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.590
So the text input and the button.

01:33.730 --> 01:38.830
So the view essentially has the height of text input and button combined.

01:38.980 --> 01:47.420
And then also the width of the broadest child in this case so if the text input here and by the way

01:47.420 --> 01:51.940
your Android just didn't update correctly that's why you see this strange output here.

01:51.940 --> 02:02.010
You can ignore that for now so to make the view take you fool away lable space here you can simply go

02:02.010 --> 02:04.320
to the style you apply to to view.

02:04.320 --> 02:11.670
In this case our input container style here and set flex to one year flex is a property which is well

02:12.120 --> 02:18.270
used in conjunction with Flex box and as you learned earlier in this module in this extra flex box lecture

02:18.480 --> 02:25.140
flex allows you to control how much space your different items inside of a flex box take and if it's

02:25.140 --> 02:26.430
the only item.

02:26.430 --> 02:29.970
This simply ensures that this container will take all the available space.

02:29.970 --> 02:34.980
You could also set this to flex to the exact value doesn't matter here if it's the only child but you

02:34.980 --> 02:39.570
need to set flex to make sure that this takes the full available space.

02:39.600 --> 02:44.160
If you don't do it it will just take as much space as its child elements do.

02:44.280 --> 02:48.850
If you set flex it will take as much space as its parent element gives it.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.720
So ask the parent element of that view.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.990
The modal in this case gives the view.

02:53.340 --> 03:00.650
So with Flex 1 added here if you now save this on ours you see now it is this nicely centered.

03:00.670 --> 03:05.860
And to also see this on Android what you can do is you can open the tasks which are closed as app here

03:06.070 --> 03:08.210
and press a year to restart.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.890
Does app on Android doesn't like the model as it seems.

03:11.890 --> 03:19.970
And now here you also see that now tiny adjustment is a little bit of spacing between the button and

03:20.000 --> 03:22.140
the input which I want to have for Dad.

03:22.250 --> 03:30.530
I'll go to the input and add a margin bottom of 10 here but with that I'm quite happy about that again.

03:30.530 --> 03:35.380
Unfortunately Android is really having some issues here with my model so let's close it and see it

03:39.120 --> 03:40.430
whenever that looks good.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.000
Yeah this is good.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.430
Now I want to make sure that when we click add here we do actually now close the modal.
