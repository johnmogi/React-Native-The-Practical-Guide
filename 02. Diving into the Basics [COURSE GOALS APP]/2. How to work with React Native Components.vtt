00:02.370 --> 00:04.560
A crucial part of reigniting.

00:04.680 --> 00:07.900
Are these components which are built into React Native.

00:07.920 --> 00:13.340
Because as you'll learn in the first section of this course these are special components for which React

00:13.350 --> 00:21.420
Native knows how to translate how to compile them to native platform widgets and you can only use such

00:21.420 --> 00:23.730
components in React Native apps.

00:23.790 --> 00:29.070
You can build your own components but these then also in the end have to be made up of these built in

00:29.190 --> 00:29.910
components.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.390
You can't use divs or paragraphs or anything like that.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.550
So we have to work with the ones built into React Native because they are rig native knows how to translate

00:38.550 --> 00:43.640
them and there we have things like The View text button touchable text input image.

00:43.650 --> 00:46.620
These are some of the components you will see from this course.

00:46.620 --> 00:51.150
There are more and we'll see plenty of them throughout the course and you will learn how to work with

00:51.150 --> 00:58.620
those how to configure them and how to compose nice user interfaces with the help of these components.

00:58.620 --> 01:04.500
Now you as a just mentioned of course build your user interfaces your custom components with the help

01:04.500 --> 01:11.130
of these built in components here so you compose your user interface your components from these built

01:11.160 --> 01:16.830
in components there and it looks something like this you build your own my title component by taking

01:16.830 --> 01:23.520
the built in ones and mixing and matching them together to get the look or the component you need styling

01:23.520 --> 01:28.770
all is an important part and React Native apps and there it's important to understand that React Native

01:28.860 --> 01:35.070
doesn't use web technologies it doesn't use HD Himmel it uses javascript arguably but doesn't use HD

01:35.070 --> 01:41.580
him and it also doesn't use C as s so CSX which you use for styling and the web is not support and react

01:41.580 --> 01:50.010
native but it gives you styling commands styling configuration you can add to your components so to

01:50.010 --> 01:55.740
these components that are built into React Native even with the help of inline styles or with so-called

01:55.830 --> 02:02.580
style sheet objects and there you write these style instructions in javascript but you use a certain

02:02.580 --> 02:09.990
text which is based on CSX so it's not directly related to CSX but of course it's influenced by CSX

02:10.170 --> 02:17.310
many of the instructions you use here are inspired by CSX and many of the rules or of the properties

02:17.310 --> 02:24.420
you know from CSX all the work here in JavaScript in your react native app now regarding the inline

02:24.420 --> 02:30.810
styles vs. styles sheet objects thing I will show both but I will already say that using style sheet

02:30.840 --> 02:34.800
object is preferred but I'll come back to that once we do use it.

02:34.910 --> 02:39.450
And with that now do we know roughly what's up with components installing.

02:39.550 --> 02:43.220
Why don't we just get started and start working with these things.
