00:02.310 --> 00:04.600
Now there's one thing you will notice.

00:05.590 --> 00:10.710
If you enter a goal here and here I will quickly use the same goal over and over again.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.000
Even though that gives me an error.

00:12.040 --> 00:17.120
But the Apple continue work to work so let's ignore the warning at the bottom.

00:17.140 --> 00:22.690
If I entered this often enough you see at some point of time will exceed the boundaries of the screen

00:22.720 --> 00:25.270
but by default you can scroll.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.800
And that's something which can be really confusing if you're getting started with React Native because

00:29.800 --> 00:31.890
of your coming from the web there.

00:31.930 --> 00:38.650
You can always scroll the browser by default makes your page scroll lable if your content exceeds the

00:38.650 --> 00:40.720
boundaries of the page here.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.300
That's not the same.

00:42.340 --> 00:48.500
You don't get scrolling just because your content goes beyond the boundaries of your screen.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.380
Instead your content is just not reachable anymore.

00:52.420 --> 00:56.530
Now obviously that's not an option that's a horrible user experience you want to have a scroll level

00:56.530 --> 01:04.330
content but in native apps you have to be explicit about the fact that this page or a part of this page

01:04.540 --> 01:08.410
should be scroll lable and it's the same and react native therefore.

01:08.440 --> 01:16.060
So here what we can do is we can use a number of component baked interact native and that's the scroll

01:16.060 --> 01:20.710
view and as the name suggests this is a view which is grown label.

01:20.710 --> 01:29.360
So now we can replace this view here which holds our list items with the scroll view on the scroll view

01:29.370 --> 01:31.980
you also got properties that allow you to configure it.

01:32.010 --> 01:38.020
You can just place your cursor here and hit controlled space to get an idea of what you can set or check

01:38.020 --> 01:39.390
out the official docs.

01:39.390 --> 01:45.150
For example you could set horizontal to scroll horizontally but here I'll leave the default which is

01:45.150 --> 01:53.240
vertical scrolling and by just adding this you will see that now if I add learn React Native a dozen

01:53.240 --> 01:54.430
times here.

01:54.740 --> 02:02.420
So let me fill that page now does a scroll of as you can see I can now scroll my content and only the

02:02.420 --> 02:04.760
part which is wrapped in the scroll view.

02:04.850 --> 02:10.850
We could have wrapped it around the entire page so we could have replaced this view here with a scroll

02:10.850 --> 02:15.250
view or wrap this with a scroll view so that would all the work.

02:16.180 --> 02:20.770
It's also something we can do and then the entire pages scroll lable.

02:20.820 --> 02:24.020
So if I now add learn React Native here

02:27.950 --> 02:33.280
you'll see that now the entire page scrolls here and I guess you can even scroll without items that's

02:33.280 --> 02:40.600
the default I was behavior but it of course always bounces back but that's up to you where you at this.

02:40.600 --> 02:46.150
And here I just want to have a subsection of the screen which is scroll lable so I only wrap this section

02:46.150 --> 02:47.170
with the scroll view.

02:47.170 --> 02:53.290
But this is of course a super important component for any content where you can't guarantee that it

02:53.290 --> 02:55.040
fits onto the screen.

02:55.100 --> 02:59.650
No of course you might think that with all these device sizes available you can never guarantee this

03:00.250 --> 03:04.810
but there are certain pieces of content like input in a button which you will always be able to fit

03:04.810 --> 03:10.780
onto the screen and which also can be configured to resize them selves to fit onto the screen whereas

03:10.780 --> 03:16.000
there is other content typically lists of data like this year where you can't guarantee it and where

03:16.000 --> 03:21.760
you just know after 10 or 20 items it will definitely exceed any screen.

03:21.850 --> 03:27.770
And that's the content you want to wrap into a scroll view over content like input buttons hardcoded

03:27.940 --> 03:29.040
static text.

03:29.140 --> 03:35.290
So basically any content where you know how many items you'll have in advance typically can be squeezed

03:35.320 --> 03:42.340
onto a screen with the right tools namely with Flex box which will also do for all at this course but

03:42.340 --> 03:46.360
for a dynamically generated content like this you definitely want a scroll view.
