00:02.390 --> 00:05.320
Of course the question is what will rebuild here.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.930
Now we'll dive into the basics here.

00:06.940 --> 00:09.800
Therefore of course here will build a relatively simple app.

00:09.830 --> 00:13.880
But already showing a lot of the core features you got to know.

00:13.880 --> 00:20.450
So the app will build here will be an app where you can save your goals for this course your course

00:20.450 --> 00:27.440
goals they offer will start by adding an input field here where you are able to enter your goal and

00:27.440 --> 00:30.100
of course then a button which adds it.

00:30.290 --> 00:41.370
And then here will have these various items these various list items below that with your goals on them.

00:41.420 --> 00:50.870
If you tap them that will delete the item so app on a tap that will be deleted but pressing that button.

00:50.870 --> 00:58.610
We of course add an item and we'll also enhance does application good for all at this module so that

00:58.610 --> 01:01.370
it also works a bit differently by the end of the module.

01:01.400 --> 01:05.090
Then we'll just have a plus button here so to save.

01:05.210 --> 01:12.230
And by pressing this button here we will open a modal which is an overlay over the screen where you

01:12.230 --> 01:13.620
can then enter your goal.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.340
And we still will have the output here.

01:15.350 --> 01:20.810
But basically the inputs will be taken away from that main screen into that modal the idea of is of

01:20.810 --> 01:26.150
course very trivial app here is that we get to know a lot of these core features these core components

01:26.150 --> 01:30.450
you work with how to install these components how to work with such a modal and so on.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.640
And we'll obviously build way more complex apps for the course of course.

01:34.640 --> 01:40.520
So let's get started with this very trivial nonetheless super important and helpful application now.
