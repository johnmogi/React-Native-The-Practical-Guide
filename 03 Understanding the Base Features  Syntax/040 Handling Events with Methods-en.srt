00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:07,570
In the last lecture, we set up state and I told you that it would be special but we don't really see

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,310
that yet.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,990
All we do right now is manage our data there and then access that in our jsx code in

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,540
the app.js

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,880
file.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,740
Let's now handle a click on this button,

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,430
we do this by adding onClick.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,660
Now this is important,

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:31,930
in normal javascript and normal html to be precise, it would be onclick with a lowercase c. Now in

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,170
jsx and that is really important,

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,180
It's onClick with a capital C.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:45,580
Still we then assign as a value the code you want to execute upon a click and there we can use curly

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,000
braces to execute some dynamic code.

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:58,240
Now typically you want to execute a function of your class, a so-called method there,

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:06,080
and there is a convention to give this a name like the following Switch Name handler maybe.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,700
Now the first part Switch Name is totally up to you but you typically use handler here to indicate that

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:20,110
this is a method you're not actively calling but you're assigning as an event handler. It's not required

18
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,910
to follow this pattern though, so you can name this whatever you want of course it is a good practice

19
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,260
to name it like this though.

20
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,570
So Switch Name handler now should be a function.

21
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,280
Now if you just said equal, right now it is just the same syntax as for the state property

22
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,540
but if we assign a function as a value here it becomes a method basically.

23
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,390
It still is a property you could say but a property which holds a function which can be executed. Here

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,330
I'll also use an ES6 arrow function,

25
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,070
keep in mind this is just a normal function

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,610
at the end. And there, I now want to edit my state,

27
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,950
well before we do this, let's see if we can call this successfully.

28
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:13,450
I will say console log was clicked so that we can see something in the console once this was clicked,

29
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:22,120
and I will go to my click listener and between the curly braces, I can now run this Switch Name handler

30
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,330
and don't add parentheses,

31
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,890
don't do this.

32
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,850
This would execute it immediately once react renders this to the dom because you execute this function

33
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,070
with the parentheses.

34
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:43,330
We only want to pass a reference and we do this by using this and then referring to that property which

35
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,340
holds a function. Important,

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,160
if you don't use the this syntax here basically where you assign a function to a property you could say, you

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,030
will run into errors if you try to use this as we will soon do in this

38
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:08,830
in this Switch Name handler function because this will then not refer to the class at runtime, simply to how

39
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,090
to

40
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,370
this works in ES5 javascript.

41
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,170
By using this ES6 syntax, we circumvent this problem which will become important later.

42
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:25,480
For now important, don't add parentheses here, just pass a reference to this function. With that, let's save

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,530
this file

44
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:33,520
and let's now open the console in the developer tools and click Switch Name and you should see was clicked

45
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,750
in your developer tools here.

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,480
Now that's nice,

47
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,230
now let's all change the state, we'll do this in the next lecture.
