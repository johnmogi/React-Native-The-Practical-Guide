00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,590
In the last lecture, we learned how to use props, how to receive them as an argument and output them dynamically

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,390
in our code.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:17,320
Now I also want to output whatever we pass between the opening and closing tag of our custom component,

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,960
and this is actually super simple too.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,610
There is a special prop we can access, react gives us access to it to be precise. In the person component

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,020
where we want to receive it

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:37,360
in the end, I will wrap my paragraph in normal parentheses so that I can write this over multiple lines

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:46,540
because I now also want to create a wrapping element simply a div and I want to wrap the paragraph

9
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:56,280
inside of this div and also add another element after this paragraph. This other element should also

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,980
be a paragraph maybe but it should be a paragraph which outputs this part

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,610
we pass in between. We can simply do that by using single curly braces to put something dynamic, accessing

12
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,680
props

13
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,150
and then here, the special children property.

14
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:28,190
This is a reserved word, we didn't pass anything as children on our persons, we only pass name and

15
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,090
age. Children refers to any elements

16
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,960
and this includes plain text as we have it here between the opening and closing tag of our component,

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,000
and you could nest complex hmtl code in-between too.

18
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,550
This doesn't have to be just text, could be unordered list with multiple list items, could be other react

19
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:57,790
components, anything can go between here. And these children are now output with this syntax,

20
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,240
of course you don't have to wrap it in a paragraph, you can use it anywhere in your jsx code,

21
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:11,080
and after saving this, we see my hobbies racing for Manu whereas Max and Stephanie still output the

22
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,230
other content only because we don't pass any children.

23
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:23,610
If we inspect it, we see that an empty paragraph is rendered though, so the paragraph's there, it's just empty

24
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:30,680
because props.children is basically undefined as null because we have nothing between opening and closing

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,570
tag.

26
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,490
This is important to know,

27
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:40,130
you can put your content into your component from outside,

28
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:48,230
not only by passing props like this but if you want to pass some structured html content also by

29
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,160
placing it between the opening and closing tag and accessing it with props.children.
