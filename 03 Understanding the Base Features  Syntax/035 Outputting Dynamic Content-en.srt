00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,620
In the last lecture, we replicated the person component,

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,350
let's now dive into outputting some dynamic content in react.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,240
Thus far we always hardcoded some html elements and I'm always saying html, you know it's jsx just

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,600
because it looks like html

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,020
I'm saying that, and some text in between.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:36,150
Now let's say we want to say I'm a person and I am X years old but X should actually be a random number,

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,910
now we can simply do that.

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:48,420
We can replace X with Math.random to get a random number between 0 and 1, maybe multiply these with

9
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,670

10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:57,620
and also use Math.floor to round it down.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:07,790
Now if we do this and save that code, well we see this output as a text, which makes sense. How would react

12
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,350
know to execute this as javaScript,

13
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:18,870
after all, maybe we want to output it as a text. If we have some dynamic content in our jsx

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,700
part which we want to run as javaScript code and not interpret as text,

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:34,910
we have to wrap it in single curly braces. So let's wrap this in single curly braces, one in front

16
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,430
of Math.floor and one after the closing parentheses.

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:47,410
Now if we save this, let's us reload, we see I'm 0, 9 and 20 years old and if we reload this again,

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,700
we see different values because it's random.

19
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:59,890
Now this is super important because this now shows us that we can output dynamic content as part of

20
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,870
our jsx content,

21
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,680
we can't define javascript class in there or anything like that.

22
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,300
We can execute one line expressions,

23
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,140
short simple expressions like simple calculations or function calls here, that is important by the way.

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,540
I could call a function here and this function might then do more complex stuff.

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:31,720
We'll actually see us calling functions once we add event handlers. Now that we're able to output dynamic

26
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,830
content,

27
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:40,270
why don't we take it to the next level and make our component more dynamic so that we can leave outputting

28
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:48,490
some generic content like person and random number and instead do something else, pass some configuration

29
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,490
from the app.js

30
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:57,790
file, maybe some html attributes we passed to person to configure what we want the output for each

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,000
usage of the person component.
