1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,800
Now that we know how to output dynamic content, let's make our component configurable, flexible and dynamic.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,110
For normal html elements, we can pass attributes like class name which we can add to any html attribute,

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,560
input element

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:26,150
also would have the value attribute for example. Now for person would be nice if we could say name

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:35,960
and maybe pass Max and age and maybe pass 28 and for the second use search, we maybe want to pass

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,750
Manu and the age of 29 and for the third use search,

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:48,120
we maybe want to use Stephanie and pass an age of 26,

8
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,200
that's not my girlfriend

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,140
by the way.

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:01:00,050
So if we do that, we want to output this and maybe we even want to take it further and for Manu, we also

11
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:09,050
want to split this in the opening and closing tag and also output some additional information like my hobbies

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,190
which could be racing.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,400
Now with all of that in place, we have to change something in our person component to handle that input,

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,000
because by default of course if we save this and we reload the app

15
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,020
our output is unchanged because we're not using this information.

16
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,500
How would we, how would react know what to do with that?

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:41,150
Well it actually is able to take these attributes and gives us access inside our receiving component

18
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,470
on object named props.

19
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:50,360
Now actually the name here is up to you but you will receive one argument in your function, one argument

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,040
which is passed into it by default by react which is an object with all the properties of this component

21
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,500
and properties means the attributes you add on your component.

22
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:10,460
Now in react land this is referred to as props which is why I named this argument props and I strongly

23
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,700
recommend doing so so that everyone else understands your code too, theoretically,

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,260
you're free to name this differently though.

25
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,720
So now that we have props, we can get access to that name and age thing.

26
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,410
So we could say I am and I'll use single curly braces to put something dynamic,

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,250
I am prop's name and I am years old.

28
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:46,130
Now here, I will keep the curly braces but replace the random calculation with props age, I'm props name

29
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,780
and I'm props years old.

30
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:56,070
Let's now save this and let's see what happens if this now reloads in our application,

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,460
if it doesn't reload, reload manually. You should see I'm Max and 20 years old,

32
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,120
Manu and Stephanie and all the ages.

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,580
So now we're having the best of both worlds,

34
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:15,590
we have a reusable component which has a clearly defined template but in there, we use dynamic content

35
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,620
which we set from outside in the place where we actually use our component.

36
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,790
This makes it really reusable,

37
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,100
think about all the possibilities which we will also explore in this course.

38
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,270
Having an input component where you can set the type from outside,

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:39,740
having this person component which might be styled like a card to output dynamic or different content

40
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,200
for the different persons,

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,920
that is truly an amazing world of features we can access here and it's one important step towards rebuilding

42
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,040
great and flexible components.

43
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,880
What about the hobbies here though?

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,660
Let's have a look at how we can use content which is passed not as an attribute but between the opening

45
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,580
and closing tags in the next lecture.
