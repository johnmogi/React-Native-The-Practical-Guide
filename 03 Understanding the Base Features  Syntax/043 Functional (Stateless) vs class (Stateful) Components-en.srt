00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,490
In the last lectures, we learned a lot about state and props,

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,030
we learned that these are the only two things which lead react to upgrade your dom if something changed.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:19,050
Now I also mentioned that when creating a component as a function, as we do for a person,

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,420
we can't use state in there because it's just a function where we return some jsx code.

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,770
Granted we could run other code before doing that

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:34,300
and you often do that if you need to transform your props for us or something like that but you can

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:41,580
set up a state property here, you can't call this set state because it's no class extending component,

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,830
the said state method is not known and we don't have methods anyways,

9
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,850
it's no class,

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,970
it's a function.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,730
And still, I mentioned that you should use this function form of components as often as possible,

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,880
and I will emphasize it here one more time,

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,180
why is this so important?

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:09,580
Because these simple components which are just functions receiving props are very clear about what they

15
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,420
do,

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,250
they only render something to the dom,

17
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:20,370
they are dynamic because of props and you can add some additional logic prior to calling return.

18
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,080
But and that's super important,

19
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,570
they don't manipulate your application state. As your application grows,

20
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,280
you will see that this is not so unimportant,

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,610
this is actually really important.

22
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,990
Most parts of your application shouldn't change the application state,

23
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,770
they should just render something to the dom. Dynamic,

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,780
yes but they shouldn't allow you to change your application state.

25
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,880
Your application state should only be changed and handled in a few selected components

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,910
also referred to as containers.

27
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,110
App.js would be such a container,

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,310
that's just another name, it is a component but we refer to it as container because it contains some

29
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,370
part of our application state.

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,580
In our demo application actually all of the application state. Here we can change something about our

31
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:22,270
app and would then we pass these changes down to for example the person component but that's it.

32
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:29,530
The change happens in app.js and once we start building the course project you will see me use

33
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,900
this pattern.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,380
I will have a few components where the state actually lives and gets changed and a lot of components

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,030
which take some inputs and then just render something to the screen but which won't directly manipulate

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,790
the state.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,970
Still you might have cases where maybe you also want to listen to an event in the person component or

38
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,670
in any other component.

39
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,770
Now of course you could turn this into a component which extends component so that you can define methods

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:11,490
which you will execute but maybe you want to listen to an event here but execute some method in app.js

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:19,990
so that you can keep that pattern of changing the name in app.js but actually listening to

42
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,370
the event in another component.

43
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:31,470
Let's have a look at how we can handle this and change a state from another component in the next lecture.
