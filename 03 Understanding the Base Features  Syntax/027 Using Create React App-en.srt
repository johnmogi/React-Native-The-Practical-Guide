00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:08,310
In the last lecture I highlighted why we want to set up a project which gives us some additional features

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,520
which make our life as a developer easier.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,990
Now as I also mentioned, there is a tool which creates such a project for us,

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,990
it's called create react app and you can simply google for it to find a link to its official github

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,450
repository.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,970
As I said, it's maintained by basically Facebook or a community around Facebook,

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:37,350
So it's the officially recommended tool for creating react projects. On that github page, you will

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,280
find installation instructions and a detailed explanation about what it does and how it works.

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,900
Feel free to read through that

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,160
but of course we're also going to learn all about that throughout this course.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,650
So let's start with the installation.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:59,880
We install it globally with npm and npm is simply node's package manager, a tool you automatically get

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:07,150
when installing nodejs which makes it easier to manage third party packages, other javascript packages

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:15,660
in the end and create react app is just such a package. To use npm, you need to install nodejs which

15
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,820
you can download and install from node

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,670
js.org.

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,540
Now there you should pick the latest version 8.5

18
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:30,030
in my case here, but if you're facing any issues with that, also try out version 6.11 or whatever

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,920
the long term support version is

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,500
in your case when you're viewing this page. Now no worries,

21
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,860
we're not going to write any nodejs code here,

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,970
you don't need to know

23
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:48,980
nodejs. We only needed to use its package manager and also for this development server which will

24
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,570
be spun up for us automatically.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,410
So simply click these buttons, download nodejs and it will spin up an installer through which you

26
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,580
can walk.

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,730
Once you did finish the installation you should be able to run the npm command here on your machine,

28
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:10,820
so let's do this together in the next step. To install create react app through npm,

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:18,680
you should go into the terminal or command prompt of your machine and there you can now run npm install,

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,500
this is available since we installed node, then create-react-app, one word with dashes between the

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,680
the words and then -g. This flag at the end installs globally on our machine so that

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,510
we can run it anywhere on the machine, which of course is what we want to do because we want to be able

33
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,700
to create new react projects wherever we want.

34
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:49,610
Now on Mac and Linux, you might need to add a sudo in front of all of that to get the right permissions

35
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,980
of running this command,

36
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,950
and if you do add it, you're probably prompted for your password too. Now once you did enter it

37
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,330
and again this is not required

38
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,100
on Windows, you will install create react app on your machine.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,170
Once this is finished, you can start creating new react projects with it.

40
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:15,000
The command can also be found on this github page I showed you earlier here but we'll of course run

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it together.

42
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,700
You'll simply run create-react-app,

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:25,040
So the package name in the end and then the name of the app, this will be the name of the folder which gets

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,400
created, where the default configuration and a lot of starting files will be placed in. I will name it

45
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,540
react-complete-guide

46
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,150
but you can name it whatever you want.

47
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,930
Hit enter and this will automatically create the folder and install all the dependencies it needs.

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:51,200
As you can see here already that is react itself, react dom to access the dom and react scripts which

49
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,570
is a package bundling all these different tools

50
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,500
I was referring to on the slide in the last lecture. Once this set up finish, you can navigate into

51
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,340
this newly created folder with cd and then the name of the project you chose,

52
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,740
in my case react-complete-guide, and then there simply run npm start.

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,590
Now for me it's showing yarn start and all these yarn commands because I have yarn installed, an

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,140
alternative to npm, but you don't need that,

55
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:27,840
you can just run npm start and this will now spin up a development server and open new page

56
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,660
already, this page here.

57
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,470
This is the starting page

58
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,890
this project gives you,

59
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,510
it is basically the starting point,

60
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,650
we will start editing it later on. And you should always keep this process,

61
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,600
You started with npm start running.

62
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,610
This is the development server I was referring to which loads your application on the browser, simulates it

63
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,490
to run as on a real web page and reloads the page whenever you change the code,

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,640
you can also find the address where it is serving it here in the terminal.

65
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,590
So always keep this process running

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,600
if you are working on your application.

67
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,970
If you want to close it you can always do this with Ctrl+C

68
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,630
but then you will not be able to visit this page here again.

69
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,730
Now with that, we got our project set up,

70
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,430
let's now have a look at what's inside there and what was created for us in the next lecture.
