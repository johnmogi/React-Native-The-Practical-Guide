1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,110
We already learn a lot about the react basics.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,870
over the last lectures. Our applications still can use some extra styling

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:20,490
I'd say though. For example, this person components would be nice if they would look like cards and therefore

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,800
be more like closed objects.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,330
Right now we can't really see the differences or we can't really see the borders between this component

6
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,740
and the other components.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,540
So styling components is obviously something super important

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,700
and right now there are two ways of styling we can implement,

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,290
I will show you both.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,770
First of all, let's add a person.css file

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:51,950
to our person component and I gave this follow the same name as the javascript file, just with a different

12
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,530
extension. Of course

13
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,850
theoretically, that file name is up to you.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:03,700
Now one important thing, whichever css code I write in here is not scoped to this person.js

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,900
component, it is global

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,870
css code.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,340
So I will define a new css class which I named Person with a capital P,

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,950
still I could add this anywhere in my application since it is global but by using my component name,

19
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,630
I can rule out the danger of and accidentally using it somewhere else.

20
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,990
So I will simply assign it to my div here, class name

21
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:32,280
Keep in mind, not class, class name is person, a string person.

22
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,820
Now down there in the css file I can now change the styling,

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:46,180
maybe give it a width of 60% and a margin of auto, to center it. Maybe

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:58,070
also give it a border of 1px pixel solid #eee, a light grey and a box shadow of 0 2px 3px and

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,650
a slightly darker gray and let's give it a padding of 16px

26
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:14,550
maybe. Finally, let's set text align to center to center all the text for now, save this css file and

27
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,470
save the person.js file where

28
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,150
I assign it as a class,

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,910
nothing happens.

30
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:30,380
Do you know why? Well because we created our css class in our css file but by default and

31
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,970
this is maybe something you didn't know because it's not necessarily intuitive but by default, no file

32
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,430
is included into your project into the code which gets created by the build workflow.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,240
You always have to import files to add them to the game.

34
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,390
So we import the person component in our app.js file

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,840
and we also import the app.css file here.

36
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,630
Now it might look strange to import a css file into a javascript file like this but thanks to web

37
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:09,290
pack which is the build tool which is in the end used by this react script package we're using implicitly

38
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,910
here,

39
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:17,510
thanks to webpack, we can actually import css into javascript though it will not really merge the two

40
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,180
files or anything like that,

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:26,240
it is just made aware of that css file and will handle that differently, will basically import it into

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
our html file.

43
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,300
So in person.js,

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,170
I will also add import to dot slash person.css

45
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,670
and here you need the file extension,

46
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,130
you can only omit it for javascript files.

47
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,690
Now with that you added this you made webpack aware of it,

48
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:52,400
it will now add to your html file and hence if you now go back you see we have this extra styling on

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,130
our components.

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,370
You can also see that if you inspect your code, we have the person class here and if you scroll all the

51
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,800
way up to the head section here in the developer tools

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,710
you see that there, we actually have these style tags which you can't find in the html file in the public

53
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,330
folder. There

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,180
we got no style tags in the head section,

55
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,970
just some links to the manifest and so on,

56
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,030
so not even to css files.

57
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,750
The reason for this is that the style text are injected dynamically by webpack,

58
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,920
this is the part I meant with it manages the imports you add.

59
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,000
And this last style tag here should actually hold your person class,

60
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,340
and there you can clearly see it's a normal global css class.

61
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,730
You also see that automatic prefixing though which is very convenient because it makes sure that we

62
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,890
don't have to do that.

63
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,650
We can write the shortest css code possible or needed and it will automatically prefix it to work

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,410
in as many browsers as possible.

65
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,550
So this is the style we set up,

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,300
let's maybe fine tune it a bit more by adding a top and bottom margin here.

67
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,930
So let's maybe set this to 16px so that we have some separation between our cards,

68
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,230
looks much better.

69
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,250
Now we got the persons here,

70
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,940
now let's also style that button and let's style it differently because I mentioned that there are two ways

71
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,910
of styling

72
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,580
we know right now at least.
