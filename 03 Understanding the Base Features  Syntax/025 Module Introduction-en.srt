00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,030
Now that we had a look at what React is and why we might want to use it, as well as now that we built

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,520
our first react app,

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:15,280
let's dive into all the core react concepts and the base syntax of react.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,180
In this module, we'll have a look at what it takes to build a real react app,

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,690
and with that of course, I also mean locally on our machine and not on codepen,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and you will learn which core features react offers and how you use them.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,990
So let's dive right into that and let's learn how we set up a local react project on our machine.
