00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,360
In the last lecture we created our project with create react app

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,980
and as I mentioned make sure that npm start, this process, is running whenever you're working on your

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,260
code.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,160
I now open the folder which was created with Microsoft visual studio code,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,030
this is the IDE I'm going to use throughout the course

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,430
but you can use any IDE or editor you want to use.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,950
For example, also WebStorm would be an alternative or Sublime or Atom or any other editor

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,000
you like.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,850
Now here, I install a theme and some extensions and you can find the exact configuration I'm using here

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,170
described in the PDF document attached to this video

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,150
just in case you want to use the same, but feel free to use your favorite set up. Whatever the theme and

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,230
set up you use, you will have the same amount of files and folders in your project.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,890
So let's know walk through all the files and folders we have here. On the root level, we get a couple

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,420
of configuration files,

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,010
these lock files here can basically be ignored,

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,800
they're just locking in the versions of the dependencies we're using, the general dependencies

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,250
our project has are defined in the package.json files. And then you can see we have three dependencies

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,360
in this project and this was all created by create react app.

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,720
As you can see, we obviously import react, here I'm using a release candidate version of react 16 at

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,520
the point of time you're viewing this,

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,710
this should be released react dom it's the same and react scripts as I mentioned is a package offering

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,900
all this build workflow, this development server, the next generation javascript feature support and

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:46,340
all these things we're using in this project. In the package.json file, there was a couple of scripts defined,

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,000
you can run these scripts with npm run and then the script name.

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,060
The exceptions start which you can also run with npm start, the command we executed and as you can

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,680
see, it uses this react scripts package to then also execute some start command there,

27
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,730
that's simply a command

28
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,900
this package makes available and this command happens to start this development server,

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,750
watch all our code, compile our code, optimize the code and do all these things. Once you're ready for

30
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,360
deploying your app, you would run npm run build to optimize it even more, not launch the development server

31
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:28,740
but instead get your optimized code stored in a folder because right now you won't see your compiled

32
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,090
code anywhere here,

33
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,770
everything happens in memory.

34
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,190
But I'll come back to deploying the application later in the course.

35
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,140
So let's close this package.json file

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:44,710
for now. The node modules folder holds all the dependencies and sub-dependencies of our project,

37
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,780
this is why we have that many.

38
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,130
We only had react, react dom and react scripts but react scripts has a lot of other dependencies,

39
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,550
all these little build tools which compiled the code and so on.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,820
You shouldn't edit anything into node modules folder,

41
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,510
it's generated automatically if you run npm install in your project folder and this was automatically done

42
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,680
by create react scripts.

43
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,160
The public folder is more interesting,

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,070
it's basically the root folder which gets served by the web server in the end, though

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,090
here it only holds the files we can edit, the script files are added in the source folder.

46
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,580
Here we got one important file index.html,

47
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,960
this is a normal html page and it is the single page

48
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,010
we have here.

49
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,760
We will never add more html pages in this project,

50
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,950
if you are creating a multi page project you would create multiple such projects here with create react app,

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,630
you wouldn't add more

52
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,690
html files here or you need your own workflow if you want to do that.

53
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:54,820
So this is the single page, where in the end our script files will get injected by that build workflow

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,200
which is why you don't see a script import here and you can edit this file but we won't write any html

55
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,160
code here.

56
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,670
I want to highlight this div here with the ID root,

57
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,910
this will become important because this will be where we actually mount our react application later

58
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,160
and we will of course work in react.

59
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,880
But if you need to add any imports to let's say other libraries, CSS libraries or want to add some

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,170
meta tags, you can do that here in the html file.

61
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,930
You could also add more html here

62
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,480
but again, you probably want to do this in react. The manifest.json file is there because create

63
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,230
react app gives us a progressive web app out of the box,

64
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:43,230
a very basic one at least and gives us this manifest.json file where we can define some meta data

65
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,630
about our application.

66
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,150
Interesting for us is this source folder,

67
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,150
here we get a couple of files and these are actually the files we will work in,

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,310
this is actually our react application.

69
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,380
Most important for us right now,

70
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:06,540
the index.js file gets access to this root element in our dom, in our html file, so the element with

71
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,000
the ID root which of course is this div we saw in the index.html file,

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,500
this one, and there as you can see it, it renders our react application with the render method.

73
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:29,940
Now here is a reference of some app object or element which we import from an app file, the extension

74
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,480
.js is left out because it's automatically added by our build workflow and if we have a look

75
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,290
at this app.js file

76
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:45,870
therefore, this is where we see our first and only react component we have in this starting project

77
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,010
right now.

78
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,580
Here we see some JSX and then we'll dive deeply into what we see here exactly in the next lectures.

79
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:01,210
For now, let's remove all the content in this wrapping div and let's simply add a h1 tag here

80
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:12,010
where I'll say hi I'm a react app, let's close it of course also and then let's save it,

81
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,200
that's always important, don't forget to save your files.

82
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,400
Now since you have npm start running, this will automatically trigger a recompilation

83
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,130
and it should automatically reload your page too which is why you should now see Hi I'm a react app

84
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,960
instead of the old content.

85
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:35,380
With that we can also removed this logo.svg file because we no longer use it in our project,

86
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,850
and now we got a bit of a leaner source folder.

87
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,040
Now what else did create react app create for us?

88
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:48,640
It gave us this app.css file which basically defines some stylings we use in this app.js

89
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,660
file, though I will say that these are not scoped to this file,

90
00:06:52,660 --> 00:07:00,370
these are still global stylings and I will actually remove everything but this first app class definition

91
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:07,240
in that file and save it thereafter. We also get an index.css file which also applies styles

92
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,540
globally and what should be used for some general set up as here for the body of our application.

93
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,020
The registerServiceWorker.js file is as the name implies important for registering a service worker

94
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,290
which is generated automatically,

95
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,490
that's related to this progressive web app we get out of the box.

96
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,180
It will basically pre-cache our script files,

97
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,160
we don't need to configure anything there. And the test file,

98
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,880
well we'll dive into testing later in the course,

99
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,380
it basically allows us to create unit tests for the different units, for example components in our application.

100
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:51,670
This is the general setup and for the majority of this course, we'll work in app.js or other new components

101
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,630
we create.

102
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,260
Speaking of that, let's analyze this file, let's understand the syntax we see there,

103
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,990
let's get rid of that logo import because we remove the logo file

104
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,530
now that I see it and let's dive into JSX, what exactly that is and how we add more components to our

105
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,730
application.
