00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:07,400
In the last lecture, we created our own component, the person component.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,640
The question is, what's the big advantage of this?

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:19,020
Components are awesome because we can focus our code in each file and hence make it much more maintainable,

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:26,690
Not put everything into the app.js file which can really get crowded for bigger apps and this component

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,110
is also reusable and configurable.

6
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,460
Now I'll come back to be configuring part, reusing it is quite simple,

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,510
we can simply copied and paste it as often as we want,

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:46,010
maybe three times and by simply doing this and saving that file, we get the output multiple times and

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,510
that is a super easy way of reusing it anywhere in our application.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,160
And if our application would contain more and more components, this would make it super easy to build

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,350
it up with all these components and use them wherever we need to use to use them

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,190
in our app,

13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,190
this is now effectively our custom html element.

14
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,230
We also can configure it though before we do that,

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,900
let's change something else about our react code because right now it's all static still,

16
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,730
we have our custom component but in there we still just have some static html

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,230
text, some html content at the end.

18
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:35,810
Now oftentimes, your templates, your jsx code should be dynamic, should output different things depending

19
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,250
on the state of your application or on some user input.

20
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:45,490
Now we will do this a lot for the course but let's lay the foundations for that in the next lecture.
