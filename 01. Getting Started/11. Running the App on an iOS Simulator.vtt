00:02.380 --> 00:06.940
So we installed Android Studio and launched the app here on an android emulator.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.560
Now let's do the same when I was.

00:08.570 --> 00:12.580
And this as I mentioned before only works on mac os.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.930
You can do this on Windows unfortunately.

00:15.100 --> 00:20.790
The first step there is that you install X code and you do that from inside your app store.

00:20.790 --> 00:26.690
So the app store on your Mac there you can simply search for X code and then install X code.

00:26.690 --> 00:30.120
I already got it installed but simply install it from there.

00:30.120 --> 00:36.020
These are the Apple Developer tools you can only install them on a Mac and you should do so there with

00:36.020 --> 00:36.770
that installed.

00:36.770 --> 00:45.740
Make sure you install the X code command line tools by simply launching X code and there without necessarily

00:45.740 --> 00:47.510
opening a project you don't have to do that.

00:47.510 --> 00:53.850
Going to X code preferences in the top left corner and then make sure you got command line tools installed

00:53.850 --> 01:00.360
here by selecting the most recent entry you have here under a command line tools that is already all

01:00.720 --> 01:09.270
you can now launch a simulator by going to X code and then open developer tool simulator here.

01:09.300 --> 01:15.900
This will now launch up an ISIS simulator.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.640
Here it is booting up.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.040
And for me it picked iPhone X here.

01:20.040 --> 01:26.010
You can change that simulator by clicking on it and then going to hardware here the voice and then selecting

01:26.010 --> 01:32.250
Iaw and you can pick different phones and if you choose a different one year it will launch a new emulator

01:32.820 --> 01:40.180
with that different configuration and here I'll just go with this iPhone X s simulator.

01:40.180 --> 01:43.220
I closed all simulators and then restarted it.

01:43.290 --> 01:49.080
And then it automatically picks the last one you'd show us here and now let's wait for disk to boot

01:49.080 --> 01:54.050
up before we can run our risk native Expo app there.

01:54.050 --> 02:00.760
Here it is running and now again go back to your NPM start process which should be up and running and

02:00.770 --> 02:06.650
in there you can hit I too launched this project on an ISIS simulator.

02:06.680 --> 02:13.530
Alternatively you can always go to the expo def tools in that browser tab and click Run on IAW simulator

02:13.560 --> 02:14.060
there.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.490
That would work as well.

02:15.490 --> 02:19.940
Here you also see some log where it tells you that it's connecting and so on.

02:19.990 --> 02:23.860
So now you're where ask where we want to open as an Expo and the answer is yes.

02:23.980 --> 02:29.240
Just as on Android it automatically installed the expo app so you don't need to do that manually it

02:29.250 --> 02:34.600
does it for you and then it launches does app and launches your project in that app.

02:34.600 --> 02:38.720
So let's again wait for that to finish click.

02:38.720 --> 02:39.880
Got it here.

02:40.010 --> 02:45.770
And here's the app and just as on the real device we can click change text to change to text.

02:45.770 --> 02:48.860
So this is the app now running on simulators.

02:48.860 --> 02:54.380
This is the setup I'll use for the course so that I can show this app on different devices here on the

02:54.380 --> 02:55.340
screen.

02:55.340 --> 03:01.640
You can test it on simulators as well you can test it on real native devices before you ever publish

03:01.640 --> 03:02.240
app.

03:02.240 --> 03:08.120
You should definitely also test on real devices though otherwise you won't know how your app behaves

03:08.120 --> 03:08.570
there.

03:08.570 --> 03:12.890
So using simulators only is not an option but for development it's of course great.
