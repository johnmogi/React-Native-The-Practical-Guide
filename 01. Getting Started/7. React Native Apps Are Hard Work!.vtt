00:02.190 --> 00:07.040
Getting started would react native apps can be really hard work.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.260
It wasn't dead hard with Expo end.

00:09.270 --> 00:15.330
Indeed generally Expo makes working with rec native pretty simple and fun but it's important to understand

00:15.360 --> 00:21.030
that React Native is not about writing javascript once and running it everywhere It's instead about

00:21.120 --> 00:27.210
learning React Native once and then write code that is flexible regarding the platform it's running

00:27.210 --> 00:32.970
on for example and you will see that throughout the course there aren't dead many components React Native

00:32.970 --> 00:39.210
ships with that would automatically adapt the way to look to the underlying platform you as a developer

00:39.210 --> 00:45.290
instead have to find out on which platform your code is running and then adjust your styles to that

00:45.290 --> 00:51.830
platform to get a look that fits the platform or maybe even adjust your logic to that platform.

00:51.870 --> 00:58.680
The same for orientation or device size changes you need to write code that is flexible you will learn

00:58.710 --> 01:03.900
all about that in this course but you will see that writing react native code is not about writing code

01:03.900 --> 01:09.870
once but instead you will have to add some if checks to find out on which platform you're running to

01:09.870 --> 01:16.190
adjust the look and feel of your app based on the platform and device size your app runs on.

01:16.200 --> 01:22.380
So to sum it up you have no or very little cross platform styling of components most components that

01:22.380 --> 01:23.660
are built into React Native.

01:23.660 --> 01:26.090
Don't come with a lot of styling attached to them.

01:26.100 --> 01:32.470
You have to take care about styling instead and you only have a basic set of pre-built components anyways.

01:32.520 --> 01:36.510
Don't expect a vast amount of pre-built components.

01:36.510 --> 01:43.020
If you worked with other alternatives like flatter or ionic you're used to having a bunch of components

01:43.050 --> 01:49.140
which are pre styled and give you a lot of awesome functionality out of the blocks React Native is much

01:49.140 --> 01:55.920
more bare bone you got some basic components which you need but then all components that would be a

01:55.920 --> 02:02.100
bit more complex are components you will have to build on your own based on these primitives you're

02:02.100 --> 02:07.350
given and indeed you will see these primitives you're getting are actually all you need.

02:07.350 --> 02:12.810
But again we're back to you will need to combine to manually install them manually and that's something

02:12.900 --> 02:16.130
our alternatives sometimes do for you for risk native.

02:16.140 --> 02:18.250
You have to do it on your own.

02:18.390 --> 02:24.840
Also as I just mentioned for creating responsive designs where your app looks good on different device

02:24.840 --> 02:30.410
sizes and different device orientations you don't really have tools that help you with that.

02:30.480 --> 02:36.300
You will have to write code that is flexible that checks to available device size and that then automatically

02:36.300 --> 02:37.410
adjusts.

02:37.410 --> 02:40.920
So there is a lot of manual work to be done by you.

02:40.920 --> 02:41.750
As you can tell.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.220
But that also gives you a lot of power.

02:44.340 --> 02:50.000
And in this course you will get all the knowledge you need to master this and build truly amazing react

02:50.010 --> 02:51.120
native applications.
