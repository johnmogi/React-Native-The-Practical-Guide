Well I come on board of this course a course where you will learn all about React Native React Native

00:07.640 --> 00:13.250
is an amazing technology that allows you to build real native apps which you can ship to the Apple App

00:13.250 --> 00:15.290
Store or Google Play store.

00:15.290 --> 00:20.810
With the help of JavaScript and the react library you don't need to know.

00:20.820 --> 00:27.650
IOW programming so you don't need to know swift or Objective C and you don't need to know Java for Android

00:27.650 --> 00:29.220
programming or Kopplin.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.310
You don't as you know anything of that.

00:31.310 --> 00:38.030
You will also not learn it here because all you'll need to build native applications real native applications

00:38.360 --> 00:42.710
with React Native is javascript and react and will react native.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.820
Which you're going to learn in this course.

00:44.840 --> 00:50.360
Now for this course you will need some basic javascript and react knowledge that is a prerequisite but

00:50.360 --> 00:52.490
you will learn everything about React Native.

00:52.580 --> 00:57.680
So all the building blocks that make up React Native all the components you got there how to style your

00:57.680 --> 01:00.880
apps and everything off that are going to learn that from scratch.

01:00.920 --> 01:07.070
In this course no prior React Native knowledge is required now in this course will start at the very

01:07.070 --> 01:07.610
basics.

01:07.610 --> 01:13.160
I'll take you all the way up to a react made f advanced programmer where you will know the ins and outs

01:13.160 --> 01:15.960
of React Native and what makes up or react native app.

01:16.100 --> 01:21.200
You will learn how to build your apps with components which components are built and how it works behind

01:21.200 --> 01:26.930
the scenes how to style your apps how to provide nice layouts that also work on different device sizes

01:26.930 --> 01:28.470
and different platforms.

01:28.580 --> 01:34.820
You will learn how to add navigation how to make sure that you can have taps or asides or how your users

01:34.820 --> 01:37.700
may go forth and back in your application.

01:37.700 --> 01:43.370
You will learn how to manage state with the help of redux also you will learn how to tap into native

01:43.370 --> 01:49.180
device features how to use the device camera or how to use Google Maps or get the user location.

01:49.220 --> 01:55.010
You will learn how to send data to a web server and store it there on the database and so much more

01:55.020 --> 01:59.380
it's all in that course and you will all learn it from scratch here.

01:59.450 --> 02:05.030
Now you will not just learn all of that from scratch you will all learn it in a practice based approach

02:05.310 --> 02:11.620
will build multiple laps in this course where we can focus on the different aspects and by having multiple

02:11.620 --> 02:18.290
apps you also got multiple locations for practicing the concepts for focusing on individual aspects

02:18.590 --> 02:24.200
and you can therefore of course also pick the specific modules in this course which sound most interesting

02:24.200 --> 02:28.100
to you since you have multiple entry points if you will.

02:28.100 --> 02:34.910
Now besides all of that there's plenty of stuff for you to fall along to code along to learn and to

02:34.910 --> 02:35.870
repeat.

02:35.870 --> 02:41.510
And therefore by the end of the course you will be a React Native developer capable of building your

02:41.510 --> 02:42.170
own apps.

02:42.230 --> 02:47.510
Diving deeper into React Native or of course also apply for weak native jobs.

02:47.570 --> 02:50.030
No that's the course content but who am I.

02:50.030 --> 02:51.950
My name is Maximilian Schwartzman.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.960
I'm a freelance web developer and five star rated instructor here on YouTube.

02:56.210 --> 03:01.040
I got multiple best selling courses do you react native course you're watching is the best selling course

03:01.040 --> 03:05.750
here and you teach me and I also got the best selling react course where you'll learn all about the

03:05.750 --> 03:11.780
react library itself which by the way is a great preparation for discourse in this course I teach you

03:11.840 --> 03:17.680
everything I know about React Native all the things that make up I react native application and therefore

03:17.750 --> 03:23.150
you got everything you need to get started with react react native and build any application you want

03:23.390 --> 03:28.730
I'm super excited to dive into all of that together with you and therefore let's not lose any time let's

03:28.730 --> 03:29.740
dive right into it.
