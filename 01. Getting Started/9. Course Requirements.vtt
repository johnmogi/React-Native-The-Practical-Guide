So what are the requirements for you to complete this course and to build native mobile apps with React

00:08.160 --> 00:09.260
Native.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.280
You need javascript and react knowledge.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.510
You don't need to be an expert.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.000
But basic knowledge is required.

00:15.060 --> 00:20.910
You don't need to know Android Java swift or objective c or Copland you don't need to know anything

00:20.910 --> 00:24.990
of that will not write code in those languages.

00:24.990 --> 00:30.170
Now regarding the hardware and software you have it depends on what you want to built.

00:30.330 --> 00:36.390
If you want to build an ISIS app which you distribute through the app store then on windows that's not

00:36.390 --> 00:42.930
possible locally but with the help of Expo you can actually build such an app there remotely which means

00:43.110 --> 00:48.330
it's getting built on exposed servers and you can always distribute it to the App Store with the help

00:48.330 --> 00:54.240
of Expo but it's a bit more difficult and if you're not using Expo you absolutely can't build IOW apps

00:54.240 --> 00:54.990
on Windows.

00:54.990 --> 00:57.870
That's simply a restriction imposed by Apple.

00:57.870 --> 00:59.240
Same is true for Linux by the way.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.530
You can't build Iwas apps there either.

01:01.800 --> 01:08.370
Android apps can be built on Windows locally with or without Expo and it's the same for Mac OS and all

01:08.370 --> 01:08.960
platforms.

01:08.970 --> 01:14.880
You can build Iaw and Android apps on Mac OS with or without export without problems.

01:14.880 --> 01:15.990
So it doesn't look too bad.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.540
I'd say no real deal breakers in here.

01:19.770 --> 01:24.330
With that let's dive deeper into React Native and learn all about it.
