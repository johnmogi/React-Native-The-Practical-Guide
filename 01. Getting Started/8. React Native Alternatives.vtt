WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:06.610
I also don't want to hide that React Native is a fast moving target.

00:06.660 --> 00:10.010
We got new words it's being published almost every month.

00:10.110 --> 00:15.480
Breaking changes do happen and of course I'll do my very best to keep this course updated to let you

00:15.480 --> 00:21.210
know about changes and how to adjust your code but sometimes you just have to go back to an app you

00:21.210 --> 00:26.610
built six months ago and you have to change something there because something changed in the latest

00:26.610 --> 00:28.170
version of risk native.

00:28.170 --> 00:33.930
And in order to continue working on your app you need to change something in the code which used to

00:33.930 --> 00:34.800
work before.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.850
That's normal.

00:35.850 --> 00:41.800
That will happen not all the time not every month but it will happen also and React Native.

00:41.820 --> 00:45.120
You typically have a high dependency on third party packages.

00:45.120 --> 00:51.600
Now the good thing is when working with Expo that's only partly true because Expo already itself is

00:51.600 --> 00:54.690
such a wrapper with a lot of cool features built in.

00:54.690 --> 01:00.060
Therefore you have a high dependency on Expo when working with that but you don't have to find dozens

01:00.060 --> 01:05.950
of other third party packages to access to camera to work with Bluetooth or anything like that.

01:06.030 --> 01:09.200
If you're building a barebones react native app that would be different.

01:09.290 --> 01:14.060
They're only a basic set of features is built right into React Native.

01:14.100 --> 01:19.320
And for most things that you want to add to your native app you would have to reach out to our community

01:19.320 --> 01:21.550
managed packages to make them work.

01:21.570 --> 01:26.600
And even with Expo we'll need a couple of third party packages to have everything we want.

01:26.700 --> 01:31.350
And that is something you have you have that dependency and that of course means that if those packages

01:31.350 --> 01:37.300
change or aren't maintained anymore you have to find alternatives or you have to update your code.

01:37.440 --> 01:44.400
So that's something you just all have to be aware of and react native simply also has some blocks not

01:44.400 --> 01:45.360
crucial ones.

01:45.390 --> 01:51.270
You can build basically any app you want with React Native but sometimes things just don't work as you

01:51.270 --> 01:56.360
would expect them to work and you need to get creative find work arounds and so on.

01:56.430 --> 02:02.640
And in this course I will also show you some of these strange things React Native has but in general

02:02.730 --> 02:09.420
when building React Native apps you have to be willing to stay updated to use google to dive into issue

02:09.420 --> 02:15.690
discussions and to simply well try things out with Expo you have a pretty smooth development experience

02:15.720 --> 02:22.770
but still the road can be bumpy from time to time now that might all sound pretty bad.

02:22.800 --> 02:27.100
So shouldn't you learn React Native tan but let's have a look at the alternatives.

02:27.220 --> 02:33.580
Of course one alternative always is that you build real native apps with the Android framework for job

02:33.580 --> 02:37.710
or Kopplin or with swift Objective C for IWM.

02:38.290 --> 02:43.180
You can't do that but of course the downside is you have to learn these languages and the huge advantage

02:43.180 --> 02:49.330
of working in one project and sharing a lot of code will be totally lost in risk native apps.

02:49.330 --> 02:54.460
Sure you will will probably need to adjust your code to the platform you're running on from time to

02:54.460 --> 03:01.330
time but the vast majority of your code base can be shared and can be reused without any adjustments.

03:01.330 --> 03:06.520
If you're using the native platform languages then you definitely have to work in two totally different

03:06.520 --> 03:12.790
projects and you won't be able to reuse a lot of code alternative 2 is that you build a progressive

03:12.790 --> 03:13.210
web app.

03:13.240 --> 03:19.300
That's a normal web app that utilizes some features that make it look and feel like a mobile app but

03:19.300 --> 03:26.230
it's not distributed through the app stores and it relies on users using a browser that supports the

03:26.230 --> 03:30.550
features you're using and if that's not the case the app doesn't run that well.

03:30.560 --> 03:38.790
The third alternative is that you use a ionic or a similar solution ionic is tool or a framework that

03:38.820 --> 03:44.790
allows you to build real native apps which you distribute fruity app stores with web technologies in

03:44.790 --> 03:50.550
the end ionic takes a normal web app and wraps it into a native app so it doesn't compile anything it

03:50.550 --> 03:53.700
just wraps it and that's a nice approach.

03:53.700 --> 03:59.320
I like ionic actually and it can be perfect for a lot of apps but of course a possible downside is that

03:59.340 --> 04:03.290
performance can be worse because you just have a wrapped web app.

04:03.330 --> 04:09.030
You have no compiled native app and that's something you do have with weak native of course and since

04:09.030 --> 04:15.060
v overall got tools and we can acquire knowledge to tops has overcome the challenges react native sometimes

04:15.090 --> 04:22.080
poses React Native is an awesome way of building native apps you can share a code you get great performance

04:22.260 --> 04:26.150
you can distributed free app stores that's pretty nice.

04:26.280 --> 04:32.160
Now one side note you also got alternatives like flatter or native script those alternatives follow

04:32.160 --> 04:37.770
a similar approach as risk native does you get a comp. app there they simply use different programming

04:37.770 --> 04:43.440
languages different frameworks and attached you find a link to a comparison video where I compare all

04:43.440 --> 04:48.690
these alternatives in case you're interested in a bit a little bit of a deeper dive into that topic

04:48.720 --> 04:49.050
there.
