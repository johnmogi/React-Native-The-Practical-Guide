00:02.310 --> 00:04.030
Now you know what's in the course.

00:04.050 --> 00:08.580
I also want to make sure that you're getting the most out of the course and therefore here are my hints

00:08.580 --> 00:14.880
at how you can or how you should work with this cause to ensure that you're getting the most out of

00:14.880 --> 00:15.540
it.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.450
Now the obvious thing is that you should watch the videos.

00:18.450 --> 00:20.190
It's a video on demand course.

00:20.310 --> 00:25.820
It's fully built to well have all these videos for you to get all the knowledge.

00:25.830 --> 00:29.220
That's how knowledge is transported in this course.

00:29.220 --> 00:32.500
Now be aware that you can adjust the speed of these videos.

00:32.550 --> 00:38.570
You have the playback controls here where you can play videos back in a faster or slower way.

00:38.610 --> 00:41.090
In case I'm going too fast or I'm going to slow.

00:41.310 --> 00:46.080
I do my best to find the best balance for all users but of course you might have a different knowledge

00:46.080 --> 00:51.600
of react or even React Native and therefore take advantage of these speed controls.

00:51.600 --> 00:56.500
All of course pause the videos and rewind if something isn't clear.

00:56.640 --> 01:01.440
And of course my recommendation also would be that you code along and therefore you might need to pause

01:01.440 --> 01:06.020
videos occasionally so that you can catch up or try something out on your own.

01:06.120 --> 01:11.190
And that's really how you get the most out of it by coding along and trying things on your own as well.

01:11.190 --> 01:16.400
So definitely all the pause videos try something on your own first before you then watch me solve it.

01:16.440 --> 01:21.750
I think that's another great way of experimenting and getting a feeling for whether you really understood

01:21.750 --> 01:23.120
something.

01:23.130 --> 01:26.360
Now also of course use all the course resources.

01:26.460 --> 01:31.000
And that's mainly of course the attached links you find on some lectures.

01:31.020 --> 01:37.650
I typically mention if something is attached and all the attached code snapshots now you'll find code

01:37.650 --> 01:44.820
snapshots on many lectures for this course reflecting the progress up to that lecture and always on

01:44.820 --> 01:47.130
the last lecture of every module.

01:47.130 --> 01:51.990
Now these code snapshots are there for you to compare your code to them.

01:51.990 --> 01:54.090
You can also run my snapshots.

01:54.090 --> 01:58.170
These attached code attachments as standalone projects.

01:58.170 --> 02:04.080
And there is a how to use text file in every attachment that shows you how to well get this attachment

02:04.080 --> 02:04.950
to run.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.850
Now definitely take advantage of this.

02:07.980 --> 02:13.650
Compare your code to mine if you're facing issues if something isn't working the way it should work

02:13.650 --> 02:19.970
or it's working in my videos all the snapshots which are attached are taken directly from the recordings.

02:20.130 --> 02:22.560
So they absolutely reflect what I showed.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.230
So if something's not working.

02:24.330 --> 02:31.110
Take my code compare it to yours maybe replace your code with mine even just temporarily to narrow down

02:31.110 --> 02:35.260
the issue and you will be able to solve all these issues.

02:35.370 --> 02:39.110
Now of course there always is a Q and A section where you can ask.

02:39.210 --> 02:45.750
Now please be aware I only can help on questions directly related to course lectures or course source

02:45.750 --> 02:46.250
code.

02:46.410 --> 02:52.290
I'm not providing any personal coaching for your own projects or your own code snippets.

02:52.290 --> 02:54.470
That's not something I can offer unfortunately.

02:54.870 --> 03:00.960
But you know action is there for you if you're facing some very strange error which doesn't seem to

03:00.960 --> 03:05.990
be related to the code or if something is unclear of some concept is unclear.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.550
Even after watching the video for a couple of times then the cute A.S. is your place to go.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.850
You'll be aware if you're just getting some error with your code.

03:14.850 --> 03:19.920
Definitely take my attached code and compare it because that will help you solve such problems.

03:20.070 --> 03:26.460
And also don't just ask in the Kuna section also help others because dad is how you will learn the most

03:26.490 --> 03:27.750
by helping others.

03:27.750 --> 03:31.450
You are challenged to dive into problems you have to solve problems.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.920
And that's always how you learn the most.

03:34.050 --> 03:37.580
And if you're sharing a solution that turns out to be wrong.

03:37.590 --> 03:39.420
That's absolutely no problem.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.790
Then you'll learn again by getting corrected.

03:41.790 --> 03:49.740
So definitely take this as an opportunity to master this topic to master react native and to get the

03:49.740 --> 03:51.270
most out of this course.
