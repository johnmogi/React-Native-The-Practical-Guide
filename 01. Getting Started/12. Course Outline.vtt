WEBVTT

00:02.380 --> 00:06.220
So what's in this chorus now what will you learn in this course.

00:06.220 --> 00:12.520
We're almost done getting started and therefore with this basic module we're well we set everything

00:12.520 --> 00:16.900
up and you get a rough idea of what we act native is and how it works.

00:16.900 --> 00:23.700
After this we'll of course have a very important module where we dive into the React Native basics in

00:23.710 --> 00:29.500
this module you'll learn all the core fundamentals you need to know about React Native how these apps

00:29.500 --> 00:35.260
work how you work with React Native components how you build your own components how you make that all

00:35.260 --> 00:39.930
work as a native app what you can test on your emulators or real devices.

00:40.090 --> 00:43.180
All of that is in this super important module.

00:43.480 --> 00:49.390
Now after all these core basics which are really important we'll also have a look at debugging.

00:49.390 --> 00:51.100
How can you track down errors.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.530
Which tools are there to help you with debugging.

00:53.530 --> 00:57.070
These are all questions we'll tackle in the debugging module.

00:57.260 --> 01:03.550
Now thereafter we will dive back into the basics but into these advanced basics if you want to call

01:03.550 --> 01:08.500
it like this we'll have a look at how you build real apps how you style apps which different options

01:08.500 --> 01:13.840
you have there how you work with all these components that are baked into React Native and with your

01:13.840 --> 01:18.300
own components that you can build based on those how you layout your apps.

01:18.310 --> 01:25.300
So here will really bring together many concepts and compose that all in a more realistic app which

01:25.300 --> 01:31.660
does more useful things and we're will need to tackle certain problems you have to tackle in Real Apps.

01:31.720 --> 01:37.600
So that's never a core module for you to learn how React Native works and how React Native apps are

01:37.600 --> 01:39.050
built.

01:39.070 --> 01:43.900
Now once you completed this module we'll have a solid understanding of all these fundamentals but there

01:43.900 --> 01:46.530
will be one problem up to this point.

01:46.630 --> 01:49.990
The apps we build thus far are not really flexible.

01:49.990 --> 01:56.050
They're not really adapting to different screen sizes and there might be differences between IAW or

01:56.050 --> 01:56.880
Android.

01:56.950 --> 02:03.910
Regarding how apps should look like or how certain things should behave which we don't really cater

02:03.910 --> 02:10.300
for deaf we will then have a module where we dive into how to build responsive and adaptive apps.

02:10.300 --> 02:15.970
So how you make sure that your apps look great and work the way it is should work on different devices

02:15.970 --> 02:19.690
different device sizes and also on different platforms.

02:19.690 --> 02:27.530
So on Android I was and how you can use one project and one code base to still fine tune your app to

02:27.550 --> 02:30.970
different platforms in certain areas.

02:30.970 --> 02:36.970
Now after all of that you'll have very solid fundamentals but will also only have worked on apps that

02:36.970 --> 02:39.260
have mostly one screen.

02:39.580 --> 02:45.640
Now in most apps you have taps you have a side drawer you can navigate forth and back between different

02:45.640 --> 02:52.180
pages and you have nice transitions and animations for these navigation actions and therefore will have

02:52.180 --> 02:59.080
a whole module dedicated to navigation and how you can build navigation into your app how you can provide

02:59.290 --> 03:05.500
beautiful transitions how you can add taps different kinds of taps to your application and all these

03:05.500 --> 03:10.980
core techniques and things that you need in most applications are going to build.

03:11.050 --> 03:17.920
Now by then we'll also have a feeling for a problem that managing state managing data in our application

03:17.920 --> 03:23.040
can be tricky as our application grows and therefore will then have a whole module where we dive in

03:23.040 --> 03:30.280
to how to manage state with the help of redux and how you can pass data around in your application.

03:30.280 --> 03:35.470
After all that it's really time to practice and therefore we'll have a whole module where we build a

03:35.470 --> 03:41.260
brand new application from scratch where we incorporate all the things we learned thus far.

03:41.620 --> 03:47.710
That's a module where you can practice on your own or you just follow along with me or you'll practice

03:47.710 --> 03:50.000
first and then compare your solution to mine.

03:50.050 --> 03:56.350
So it's a big practice module where all these core things we learn about come together and can be seen

03:56.350 --> 03:57.590
in practice.

03:57.660 --> 04:02.830
Now after that we'll take that same app and enhance it for example by handling user input in a better

04:02.830 --> 04:10.720
way by validating it by showing error messages by making sure that our app has certain data criteria

04:10.810 --> 04:14.670
that needs to be fulfilled before we can continue ends on debts.

04:14.740 --> 04:20.840
And now our core module because of course in many applications you'll need to gather user input.

04:20.840 --> 04:27.790
Now thereafter we'll all leave our application in a certain sense because we'll learn how to send data

04:27.790 --> 04:31.760
to a server and store it on that server in a database.

04:31.780 --> 04:36.130
Of course it's a a crucial task because not all data lives on your device.

04:36.130 --> 04:41.770
Instead there is some data that needs to be shared with our users for example or that should be backed

04:41.770 --> 04:48.400
up or that should be a way lable even if users reinstall your app and for all of that that data needs

04:48.400 --> 04:50.000
to be stored away from your app.

04:50.050 --> 04:54.340
It needs to be stored on a server it needs to be stored in a database and that's exactly what we'll

04:54.340 --> 04:58.200
have a look at in this HDTV requests module now.

04:58.230 --> 05:05.790
Speaking of services on many applications all need user authentication you need to be able to sign users

05:05.790 --> 05:08.900
up and locked him in locked him out manage their session.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.250
And that's exactly what we'll have a detailed look at and user authentication section and NAV records

05:14.250 --> 05:19.800
section with a number a core feature that you need in many applications and we'll have a detailed look

05:19.800 --> 05:21.950
at all of that in this module.

05:22.170 --> 05:27.320
After this module you will have a lot of core building blocks you need for apps you typically build.

05:27.510 --> 05:32.730
But one thing will be missing and that's how you tap into native device features how you can use the

05:32.730 --> 05:38.730
device camera how you can get the user location or how you can use Google Maps and that's what we'll

05:38.730 --> 05:44.280
have a look at in this native device features module you will learn how you can get the user location

05:44.310 --> 05:51.360
how you can use it how you can store it on a on the vice sequel lts database all that fun stuff is in

05:51.360 --> 06:00.140
this module and therefore this is another crucial module of course now there after all dive in two different

06:00.140 --> 06:06.050
ways of building your risk native app because for the majority of discourse we actually use Expo the

06:06.050 --> 06:11.750
tool we got started with and is first course module because it makes building React Native apps such

06:11.750 --> 06:17.070
a breeze at such fun it's easier and therefore definitely my recommended approach.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.910
But you might not always want to use it.

06:19.910 --> 06:26.840
And in this module I explained when you might not want to use it and how you then build apps without

06:26.840 --> 06:33.920
it though I can already have a little spoiler at this point for most applications the vast majority

06:34.100 --> 06:39.740
Expo is an amazing tool and all the important really important all what you'll learn in this course

06:39.950 --> 06:46.160
can be applied to Expo and non Expo apps and I make that clear in this different workflows module as

06:46.160 --> 06:52.440
well and a show how non Expo works work and how you write code for them and surprise.

06:52.520 --> 06:56.130
It's exactly the same as you learn in the rest of the course basically.

06:56.540 --> 07:02.060
Now they're after we of course aren't really there to just build app and that throw it away.

07:02.090 --> 07:04.280
Instead you typically want to publish it.

07:04.400 --> 07:09.350
So we'll have a whole module focusing on how you publish apps and we'll not just have a look at how

07:09.350 --> 07:12.100
you build it and how you then get it into the App Store.

07:12.110 --> 07:18.320
We also will have a look at over the air updates for example how you can automatically update the installed

07:18.320 --> 07:24.140
apps without forcing your users to read download an updated version which is really amazing so that's

07:24.140 --> 07:27.160
all covered in this module.

07:27.180 --> 07:31.860
A lot of content all these modules of course are extremely detailed.

07:32.040 --> 07:37.230
You'll get tons of knowledge about React Native and by the end of the course you'll be able to build

07:37.230 --> 07:39.120
amazing react native applications.
