00:02.240 --> 00:05.200
So now did we have an idea of what React Native is.

00:05.390 --> 00:11.330
We can get started with React Native and I'd say let's get started by building our first little react

00:11.330 --> 00:15.530
native app or by getting our first three act native app up and running.

00:15.620 --> 00:20.750
So we want to create a new react native app and as it turns out we actually got two options for that

00:21.750 --> 00:27.690
if you search for React Native you'll find your official page and all that visual page if you click

00:27.690 --> 00:31.520
on get started you actually have q options here.

00:31.560 --> 00:36.630
You have the expo seal a quick start and you react native seal a quick start.

00:36.630 --> 00:43.080
Now what's the difference and which approach should you use and why and what will we use in this course

00:44.400 --> 00:51.180
so we can use the expo Seelye the expo tool for generating and managing our ReACT native app or we use

00:51.180 --> 00:52.870
to react native Seelye.

00:53.010 --> 00:58.260
Now if you first have that choice you would probably go for do you react native Seelye because you want

00:58.260 --> 01:00.810
to build the react native app after all right.

01:00.870 --> 01:03.020
Well let's have a look at what Expo is.

01:03.090 --> 01:06.150
It's a third party service which is completely free to use.

01:06.150 --> 01:11.430
You don't need to sign up to get started and you don't have to pay to build an app which you can publish

01:11.430 --> 01:12.150
to the App Store.

01:12.180 --> 01:18.580
So it's really free to use what Expo gives you is kind of a managed app development workflow.

01:18.630 --> 01:24.840
It takes a lot of complexity away from you because building react native apps can be very complex especially

01:24.840 --> 01:31.410
when it comes to integrating certain native the wise features like accessing the camera and expo simply

01:31.410 --> 01:33.070
gives you a lot of convenience there.

01:33.090 --> 01:37.920
It makes development of risk native apps a breeze and so much easier.

01:37.920 --> 01:44.820
The downside is that you're limited to the expo ecosystem because expo in the end is like a rapper you

01:44.820 --> 01:52.110
could say around your app a thin extra layer between your app and the native raw react native experience

01:52.680 --> 01:57.810
and you still get a native app and you end and you still use React Native under the hood that's all

01:57.810 --> 02:04.530
happening but Expo abstracts away some of the complexity which also means it of course removes some

02:04.530 --> 02:11.450
of the fine grained control you would normally have if you build a raw react native app because if we

02:11.450 --> 02:17.390
have a look at that our workflow the risk native CLIA that's in yet managed by any react native Timor

02:17.420 --> 02:19.580
parts of the react Native community.

02:19.640 --> 02:25.670
And there you have a bare bone development setup which means you get a native app you need to install

02:25.700 --> 02:32.420
Android Studio you need to install X code to built that app and you need to configure and manage a lot

02:32.420 --> 02:33.190
on your own.

02:33.290 --> 02:38.990
As soon as you start adding certain native the wise features like let's say as soon as you want to use

02:38.990 --> 02:44.540
the device camera you will have to bring in third party packages where the set up process can be quite

02:44.540 --> 02:47.600
complex and therefore this can be more cumbersome.

02:47.600 --> 02:53.570
You have pretty much no convenience or utility features to tap into but of course the advantage would

02:53.570 --> 03:00.050
be that you have full control you can control every tiny piece you can easily write your own native

03:00.080 --> 03:03.210
Android in Iowa's code and connect this to your javascript code.

03:03.230 --> 03:05.390
That's not really possible with expo.

03:05.600 --> 03:10.340
So if you are a super advanced developer and you already know you'll be building a very complex app

03:10.370 --> 03:17.270
where you need to do a lot of manual work arounds a lot of fine grained configuration then you definitely

03:17.360 --> 03:20.150
want the full barebones experience on the right.

03:20.240 --> 03:25.820
If you were getting started or if you're building a normal app then the Expos you lie will very likely

03:25.820 --> 03:27.020
give you everything you need.

03:27.050 --> 03:32.060
It gives you wrappers for the most common native device features you need like using the camera like

03:32.060 --> 03:32.870
using maps.

03:32.870 --> 03:35.330
That's all made super simple.

03:35.330 --> 03:42.740
And if you ever get to a point where you find out oh I need more control then you can always also switch

03:42.800 --> 03:45.620
from the actual workflow to the native workflow.

03:45.620 --> 03:52.160
You can eject and then you have the full flexibility therefore nothing speaks against getting started

03:52.160 --> 03:56.840
with Expo you can always switch to the average experience if you need to and we'll use expo in this

03:56.840 --> 04:02.030
course because it's simpler because it gives you everything you need for most apps because it's so much

04:02.030 --> 04:05.370
more convenient to work with and because you can always switch.

04:05.510 --> 04:11.750
Now later down in the course I will also give you an introduction to the more bare bone workflow and

04:11.840 --> 04:17.850
what that would mean for you but for the majority of the course will work with Expo behind the scenes

04:17.850 --> 04:24.390
does Expo to work such that you have your native device or your simulator so your iPhone or your Android

04:24.390 --> 04:27.740
phone and you have your app your react native app.

04:27.750 --> 04:28.700
We will be writing.

04:28.710 --> 04:35.310
So your javascript code where you write your react native app now on your native device or on the simulator

04:35.550 --> 04:42.030
you will install extra app from the App Store the expo client app and we'll do that together in the

04:42.030 --> 04:43.830
next lecture.

04:43.830 --> 04:50.340
Now your app can then be loaded into the client app which is this extra wrapper to see it there to run

04:50.340 --> 04:51.500
it there to test it there.

04:51.510 --> 04:54.180
And that's of course great for development.

04:54.180 --> 05:02.070
You can also publish your app as Expo app so that other people who have the expo client installed can

05:02.130 --> 05:03.500
easily run your app.

05:03.510 --> 05:07.550
They don't even need to install it from the Google Play store or the Apple App Store.

05:07.740 --> 05:12.870
But of course typically you want to build an app which you can publish to these app stores and no worries

05:12.990 --> 05:14.880
that's possible with Expo 2.

05:15.120 --> 05:20.190
That extra client app which you have which wraps your app is great for development because it speeds

05:20.190 --> 05:21.800
up the entire development workflow.

05:22.080 --> 05:28.350
But if you want a standalone app so app that is not relying on that Expo client which most of your potential

05:28.350 --> 05:36.260
users probably won't have installed well then Expo also allows you to build and publish standalone apps.

05:36.330 --> 05:43.350
So apps that do not rely on the Expo client being installed so therefore with Expo you can build normally

05:43.350 --> 05:49.950
apps which are distributed to the normal app stores standalone where your users don't need any special

05:49.950 --> 05:55.390
app installed but you have that extra convenience during development which is great.

05:55.440 --> 06:02.040
And as I mentioned before if you would need to you can always switch or eject as it's called to the

06:02.040 --> 06:04.020
non Expo development flow as well.
