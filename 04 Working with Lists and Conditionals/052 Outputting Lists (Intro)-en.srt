00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,250
Over the last lectures, we learned how to output content conditionally and that we simply take advantage

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,310
of the fact that everything is javascript.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:20,100
Now I want to render my list of persons, thus far we're not really doing this in a dynamic way.

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,000
We have a couple of persons here in our state and this should be our single source of truth.

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,090
This should be our data source in bigger applications, in real applications,

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,010
this might be populated from data or with data you fetch from a server.

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:46,260
So here, we got an array of persons but in the jsx we return here in our conditional

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,400
now, we simply hardcoded three persons and manually assigned data to the different persons in our array

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,470
this of course is super inflexible.

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:04,560
If we ever change something, if we add a new person or remove one, this will basically break and we can't

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,200
even address a specific person when updating it like we do here with the click or the changedHandler.

12
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,400
This is all not really working in the way it should work,

13
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,170
so let's learn how we can output lists of data, arrays basically and how we can also then interact

14
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,620
with them, update them and correctly change arrays

15
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,500
in our state. We'll focus on all these things over the next lectures.
