00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,800
In this module we learned a lot about conditionally outputting content and outputting lists

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,740
and I just want to briefly summarize this before I send you off to the assignment

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,360
and let you practice that because it's so crucial to get it right and to understand it.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:27,630
We did learn two important things, that we should output content conditionally by using javascript and

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,220
the same for lists.

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,910
Everything is javascript, key takeaway.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:41,280
You can then either do it with ternary expressions as you learned but a better approach is to simply create

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,680
variables which you output in your jsx you return in the end and which you adjust with if statements

9
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,240
if you want to render something conditionally.

10
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,700
And if you want to return or render a list, you use the map operator,

11
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:03,600
a default javascript method you can use on arrays to map your javascript array of objects or strings

12
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:10,890
or whatever is inside of it into an array of jsx elements and react will then pull out these elements

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,710
and render to the screen for you.

14
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,860
You also learned that map gives you not only the element for which it's currently executing this function

15
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,820
but also access to the index if you need that, for example, to remove an element that you should add this key

16
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,420
to let react efficiently update everything and that you have a couple of tools, as you can see here

17
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:42,180
for updating the name to really execute code on the element of a list on which something really happens.

18
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,530
You learn a lot of useful things here but the best way as always is to just practice it.

19
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,680
So let's move on to an assignment so that you could put all these things you just learned into practice

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,860
on your own.
