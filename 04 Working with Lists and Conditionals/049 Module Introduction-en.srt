Welcome to this module. In the previous module, we learned the base syntax of react and you learned how you create

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,770
react apps, how you create components and how you work with jsx to render something to the screen.

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,380
In this module, we'll take it to the next level.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,380
We already had a look at how we can output dynamic content with these single curly braces.

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,090
In this module we'll have a look how we can also output content conditionally,

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,750
so for example, that you only want to render a certain part of your dom, of your html code if a certain

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:46,280
condition is true and how we can output lists of data. We actually do have such a list in our demo application

8
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:53,030
already, the persons we have there, well it would make sense if we could create them dynamically based on

9
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,980
the number of persons we have in that array we manage in the state.

10
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,710
We'll have a look at all of that and what to watch out for in this module.
