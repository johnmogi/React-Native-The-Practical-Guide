00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:09,590
So let's dive into error messages in react application. In the project you worked on thus far, in

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:20,480
the nameChangedHandler, I'll add an error. In the code there where we assigned person, the updated person

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,220
here,

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:28,300
we reach out to event target value to get the value the user entered. Here where I assigned a value,

5
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:35,900
let's say we're not accessing event target which is correct but event input which is incorrect.

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,920
Well let's say we made this mistake,

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,300
now if you go back to the application on the first look it seems to work,

8
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,410
we toggle a person, it still works but if I start typing we actually get an error,

9
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,840
and in our development workflow, we even get a nice display of the error here in the middle.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,400
Now let's focus on the error message on the right,

11
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,900
always scroll up all the way to the top to see your error message

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:05,260
and there you see cannot read property value of undefined.

13
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,280
You also get a hint at where this occurred in nameChangedHandler

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,610
app.js

15
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,200
line 27, and it's displayed even nicer here in the middle,

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,880
you get it highlighted event input value.

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:27,080
So this line seems to be incorrect and there is no value property on undefined, now that simply means

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,510
the part prior to value,

19
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:36,180
so this part here, is undefined which is the case because there is no input property on event.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,470
Now you still need to figure out the target is correct on your own

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,110
for example by looking into the event documentation that's the you can look into the normal html

22
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,080
input event documentation

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,590
but you get a clear clue about what went wrong and where.

24
00:01:51,740 --> 00:02:00,440
Now sometimes error messages are less helpful than this one is, even if the error message itself is cryptic.

25
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:07,130
Most of the time you should get a helpful line number which allows you to go back into your code and

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,400
try to find out what's wrong about this line,

27
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,980
this should be helpful and should allow you to fix the value.

28
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,570
This is how you react on react error messages,

29
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,810
don't get afraid,

30
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,920
don't panic,

31
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,400
oftentimes these error messages are really useful,

32
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,480
you should read them and you should have a look at the line numbers

33
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,950
they point you to.

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,810
Now what about logical errors though?

35
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,370
Let's have a look at these in the next lecture.
