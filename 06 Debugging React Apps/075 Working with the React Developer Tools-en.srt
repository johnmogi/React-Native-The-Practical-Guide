1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,020
Now you learned how to read and understand error messages and how to find logical errors.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,860
Sometimes you want know the current state of your react app and whilst you might be able to figure

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,500
that out with the developer tools, it can be inconvenient.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,120
Thankfully there is a cool extension you can add to Chrome, the react developer tools,

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,730
let's install it together.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:32,760
You can simply google for react developer tools and you will find the github repository where you can learn

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,700
more about them, how to use them and can even contribute to the project or you head right to the Chrome

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,610
web store.

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:39,890
Now,

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,400
no worries,

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,930
these are free. In the Chrome web store,

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,630
I already added them to Chrome but you can click add to Chrome if you haven't done so.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:54,960
Once you added them, you probably need to restart Chrome and thereafter in the chrome developer tools,

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,210
you can choose react, this new tab should be available

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:06,810
now. Very cool thing is you now see your react app as you created it,

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,330
if you click toggle person you see something which differs from the normal elements tab you have though.

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,260
You don't just see the dom elements you see your components to like the person component here or the

18
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,670
app component.

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,840
And down there at the button, you also see props and state of that component,

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,590
so for the app component you see the person's array

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,500
and if I click on a person, remove it, this is updated too.

22
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,860
So here you can see your state, you can also change it there and for the person component,

23
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:47,430
you see it doesn't have a state but it has props and which props these are. You can also highlight updates

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,480
so that you see highlighted here

25
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,430
what changed in your code, like the addition of this class name for example,

26
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,070
so that's pretty cool too.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,650
It allows you to quickly understand the state of your components of your app and manipulate it and give

28
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,560
you some insights you can't easily get with the normal developer tools because it goes beyond showing

29
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,850
what was rendered,

30
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,500
it shows you what's behind the scenes, what's under the hood

31
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,140
basically.
