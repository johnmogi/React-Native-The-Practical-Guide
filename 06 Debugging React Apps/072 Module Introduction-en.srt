00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:10,650
Welcome to this course module. We learned a lot of things about react and we already also saw some errors

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,790
in our react application.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:21,900
Now no matter how good of a programmer you are, you are going to hit errors, either error messages or

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,680
most of the time

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,390
worse than that, logical errors.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,460
Now in this module, I will show you how you can debug your react application, how you should read and

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,340
understand react error messages

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,940
because a lot of them are actually quite good and helpful and how you can then create a react application

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,270
which is error free.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,940
Let's dive into this and let's learn the various techniques you have at your disposal to understand

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,660
and handle errors.
