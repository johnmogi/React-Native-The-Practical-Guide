00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,330
In this module we had a look at how we can read react error messages, that they can be quite

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,520
helpful, that we shouldn't get shocked if we see them and that we should always check the line numbers

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,810
we see in the error messages.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,610
You also learned how to debug logical errors with the help of source maps and the chrome developer

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,630
tools where you can place breakpoints and go through your code.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
You also learned how to use the react

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,680
dev tools to get insights into the state of your application and you learned how to use the error boundary

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,670
here to wrap code which might fail at runtime which you can prevent and then show a custom error message

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,100
or some fallback page or content. Don't over use them

10
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:55,020
but with all these tools, you should have a rich tool set to create hardened and safe and well working

11
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,090
react applications.
