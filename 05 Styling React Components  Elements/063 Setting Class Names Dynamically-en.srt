00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,560
In the last lecture you learn how to set styles dynamically. In the end, you learned you simply use javascript

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,080
to manipulate whatever you then bind to that style property.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,230
Now class name of course also can be set dynamically, like here for the app

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,720
but we can also introduce a new class to have something to play around. So we could for example say that

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,800
we want to change something in our code here.

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:39,640
Let's say this paragraph here, this is really working depending on whether our list of persons has three

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,740
elements as it does have at the beginning or less.

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,290
So maybe we want to color the text red

9
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:53,440
so I will add a new class which I'll name Red, normal css class reset to color red and

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,730
this will of course affect the text color, and maybe we even want to make it bold so I'll name a class, I'll

11
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,010
create a class named bold,

12
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,870
the name is up to you if we are at one element left so font-weight bold.

13
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,920
I get two new css classes,

14
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,850
these are available globally

15
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,990
but right now I'm not using any.

16
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:21,430
I now want to set the class name of this paragraph dynamically depending on the length of the elements

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:32,170
in my person's array here, below 2 or 2 or less elements I should say turn it red, 1 and less red and

18
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,020
bold.

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:44,140
So to do that, I of course also need to adjust the classes or the class name I set to this paragraph dynamically.

20
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:50,950
So what I'll do is I'll create a new variable here which I'll name classes and the name is totally up

21
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,800
to you,

22
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,850
where I in the end will create an array of strings.

23
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,990
This is one way of doing that, here

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,340
I will add red and bold and these are just the class names I defined here,

25
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,660
red and bold without the dot,

26
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,170
just the class name.

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,820
I will then call join here and join them with an empty space,

28
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:22,790
this will turn this array of strings into one string which is in the end just red bold,

29
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,050
this is what we'll get in the end.

30
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,200
This is a valid css class list we can assign to class names.

31
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,530
And of course I could've create it this manually but I will soon edit this array dynamically which is why

32
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,670
I want to have a generic solution.

33
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,210
I can now go to this paragraph and add class name

34
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,340
and of course I don't have to bind this to a string as I do here.

35
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,640
I can also bind this dynamically with single curly braces to the classes variable I have which keep in

36
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,400
mind is just a string joined with an empty space.

37
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,620
If I now save this and make sure you also saved the app.css file,

38
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,100
now let's go back to the application and it's red and bold,

39
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,670
right from the start without us touching any persons

40
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,800
that sounds a bit weird but you know what I mean.

41
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,280
So it's red right from the start because we've always assigned these classes.

42
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,290
Now we can add some dynamic nature to that,

43
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,450
we only want to do that if it's less than one person, otherwise should be red.

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,730
If it's less than 2 or less and equal actually and if we have all three persons, none of these classes

45
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,440
should be attached.

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,600
So let me actually do something else, I'll remove the join statement here and set classes to an empty

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,200
array

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,660
and then I will simply add an if statement here

49
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:51,930
and if this.state.persons.length is smaller or equal than 2,

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,040
So only two or less persons left,

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:01,990
I will take classes, this variable and actually let is just ES6 version of var

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,750
but we can use const here because I'm never assigning a new value.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,270
So if this is less than two, I will call push, the normal javascript push method to push the red class

54
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,510
onto this array.

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,750
So at this point of time, classes will be red like this.

56
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,680
I also will add another if check where

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,760
I will say if state.persons.length is smaller or equal than one

58
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,090
and please note, this is no else if condition,

59
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,460
it's just another if statement or if check coming after the first one because I want to run both.

60
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:48,360
So if it's even smaller or equal than one, then I will reach out to classes again and push another class,

61
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,290
the bold class,

62
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:57,590
so at this point of time classes is red and it's also bold.

63
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:04,400
Now if we have only two elements in the persons array, we will just have red and we will skip this because

64
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,000
this condition here will be false.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,450
Now we've got an array of classes which might look like this or like this or be an empty array

66
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,680
if we have all three elements. So I want to assign it here and classes like this won't work anymore because

67
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,530
now it's an array,

68
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,720
we need to pass a string here though.

69
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,470
Well I can simply call join with an empty space in between,

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,000
so a whitespace character on classes here when I assign it, I could of course also do this prior to

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,520
this and store it in a new variable.

72
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:43,780
With that, I'm now assigning a string which is simply my joined array, either nothing, either just red

73
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,050
or red and bold with a white space in between.

74
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,670
And now with that let me save this and go back, if it now reloads,

75
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,100
it's a black text by default.

76
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,030
Now let's toggle the persons and let's remove one,

77
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,410
now it's red but not bold.

78
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,750
If I remove another one now it's also bold

79
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:09,370
and now if I've removed a third one it stays like this obviously. This is showing how you can also dynamically

80
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,540
edit and assign classes

81
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,960
and I can't emphasize it enough,

82
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,310
everything is just javascript.

83
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,940
So you work with your array of classes here as you do with a normal array because it is a normal array

84
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,760
in normal javascript and all you do in the end here is you have to make sure that you actually assign

85
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,080
a string as we do here with the join method.

86
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:39,040
And of course you could have whatever logic you need to construct an array of classes or get a string

87
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,110
with css classes by other means without joining an array, whatever you have.

88
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,410
Maybe take some user input which is a string by default,

89
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:53,410
you can assign anything which is a valid string to class name and it will then be handled as a list

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,220
of css classes which hopefully meet the classes you set up in your css file.

91
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,760
So with that you learned how to dynamically assign styles, edit them and dynamically assign and

92
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,060
edit classes.
