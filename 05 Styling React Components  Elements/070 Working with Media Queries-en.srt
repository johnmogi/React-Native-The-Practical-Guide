00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,220
We learned how to use pseudo selectors and how we may even nest classes and still import them on that

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,890
class object here in the previous lecture.

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,080
Now I want to take care about media queries

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,350
and that was something I wanted to do in my person class. There

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:27,660
I assign the person css class to the outer div and I actually already added the code earlier.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:34,630
I will simply comment it in, some normal css media query adjusting our Person class with this

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:43,750
width if we have a viewport being broader than 500px. You can save this adjusted css file and

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,140
it will still import this person class

9
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,270
fine on this classes object here,

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,330
even if it's wrapped inside a media query. So what we should see is that if I reload the application and I

11
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,780
toggle my persons here, if I increase the viewport the width of the boxes doesn't change,

12
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,240
it only changes if it's small enough,

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,180
there it will be 60 percent of the width.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,890
So that was super simple and what can be kind of challenging to wrap your head around css module,

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,320
simply think about this classes object here as a javascript object which gives you access to a string

16
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:31,390
version of your css styles, of your css class but of a css class which was adjusted to be unique.

17
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,220
So it will simply just translate your person class to something like.

18
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:36,810
Person_

19
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,380
some unique cache, so that you can be safe and sure that when you use that class in a given

20
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,130
component, that's the only place where the css styles apply.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,510
No where else in your application can these styles have any effect,

22
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,750
that's the idea behind css modules.
