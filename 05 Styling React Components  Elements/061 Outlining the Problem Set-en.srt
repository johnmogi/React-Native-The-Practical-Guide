00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,200
I'm back in the project we worked on thus far.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,810
We get some basic styling in there,

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,180
for example these cards where we output the persons and this button.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,130
But let's start with that button for example,

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,590
we already have one issue, when we hover over it,

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,670
it doesn't change that style.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,150
The problem is that this button which is part of our app component we can see it here in our template

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,810
there, that this button simply is styled with inline styles, we assign them here and we set them up earlier

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,480
in the render method here.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:46,150
We use javascript to create an object and assigned that to the style property and jsx and react takes

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,260
care about setting this on the actual html element.

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,050
The issue is we can't use pseudos selectors here.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,210
The advantage of course is the styling is only applied to this button and to no other button in the

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,690
application if we had another button. And I already mentioned the alternative would be to style it in

15
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:15,270
the css file and there we can use normal css including pseudo selectors like hover but this would then

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:22,040
globally affect all buttons in our application, even if they were placed in other components.

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,300
This the problem set I want to deal with in this module but besides that, I also want to have a look

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,550
at something else.

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,880
What if we actually want to change styling dynamically?

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,480
Let's start with that, let's say Toggle Persons, this button should have a green background color

21
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,450
if we are about to show persons with a click and a red background color

22
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:55,720
if we are about to remove the person list. Let's see how we can dynamically change styles in the next

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,520
lecture.
