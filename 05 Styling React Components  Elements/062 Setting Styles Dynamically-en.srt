00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,410
So with the problems I outlined in the last lecture, let's dynamically adjust the button style depending on

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,580
whether we're about to show persons or not.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:17,920
Now we already had a look at how we can dynamically render content like here with the if statement where

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,400
we store some jsx in a variable and then output that variable in our template or in our return function

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,660
here I should say.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,910
Now as always everything here is javascript

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,680
so if we assign a style to the button here, this part between the curly braces can be any javascript

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,740
expression.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,330
For one, we could of course pass a javascript object here where we define the styles or we can of course

10
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,600
reach out to the style property,

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,080
excuse me, variable I should say as we do.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,350
and we could adjust this style variable dynamically

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:03,170
therefore. Basically here, this state showPersons, if this is true this means persons can be seen.

14
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:10,030
So as I outlined in the last lecture the button should then have a red background because a click will

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,780
remove the persons. On the other hand,

16
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:18,500
the default setup should be to not have a white background color but a green one

17
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:25,680
and maybe we want to set the text color to white so that it does stand out with the normal color property.

18
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,860
Now if I state this, we have a green background color,

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,350
if I click on it, we see the persons.

20
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,730
Now that the persons are visible though, this should get a red background color.

21
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,110
So what we can do is in our if statement which we already have where we set a person's variable, we can

22
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:51,810
of course do more besides setting this person's variable here. After doing that,

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,630
I can also reach out to style and set the background color property which the style object clearly has,

24
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,640
we set it up here to red of course, simply like that.

25
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,380
So we simply get into this style object,

26
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,900
we don't assign a new value so it's still a constant

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,610
but we assign a new value to one of its properties, to the background color

28
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,980
and with this tiny change in place, we already got dynamic styling.

29
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,880
Let me reload this application,

30
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,770
green button, red button, green button and so on.

31
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,870
So this shows one crucial thing which you really have to wrap your head around if you haven't already,

32
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,580
everything is javascript,

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:45,800
I guess I said this before. We change the style dynamically just as we change this variable persons dynamically

34
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,530
just as we change anything dynamically, we're talking about javascript here.

35
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,230
You can manipulate the style object with any javascript code you want and in the end when you then bind

36
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,360
it here, it will simply apply this no matter how you edited it.

37
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,850
This is a crucial take away and this shows you how you can dynamically assign cells,

38
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,010
now what about class names though?

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,030
Can we also set these dynamically, can we pass a list of class names?

40
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,030
Yes we can and I will show you how it works in the next lecture.
