Welcome to another new module, over the previous modules you learned a lot about creating components

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:16,580
and using the various react and actually native javascript features to display dynamic content, output

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,740
dynamic content in jsx code and much more.

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,130
We also briefly touched on styling react components,

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:33,020
I did it with inline styles and I showed you how to import a css file to apply these css styles,

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,660
I also mentioned that these weren't scoped to the components you imported it in.

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,990
though. In this module, I want to focus on styling react components because there's more to it than what

8
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,760
you saw thus far.

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,020
For one, I want to have a look at how you can dynamically adjust styles or class names

10
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:59,480
and I also want to show you how to work around this restriction of either using inline styles and hence

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,350
having scoped styles but having limitations like not being able to use media queries or pseudo selectors

12
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,540
or using css files and then having global styles. There are a couple of ways of handling this

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,440
and we'll dive into all of these ways of working with styles in this module.
